M. Blatchley,2.5,"Extremely tough grader. With the long articles she assigns, the papers you have to write for them, you almost always have to rewrite. When you rewrite it, things that were right on the first paper, will be wrong on the second paper after rewriting it. Hard class, but is willing to work with you outside of class.","Essays due almost every week, usually based on a 20 page article.",Decent. Her topics are odd but she gives the opportunity for peer edits and really tries for everyone to understand. Don't worry about her deadlines she will extend them. Her style is odd and quirky but worth it for a decent grade. Her lectures are usually pretty boring but participation and attendance are key. Use her office hours if needed.
R. Sureshkumar,5.0,"This class was not the easiest, but the professor really helps you succeed. He will go over homework questions and the tests were not too difficult, but the material is very dense. All lecture notes are posted, and there are random in-class quizzes that are extra credit. The midterm and final were open notes. Overall a very good professor.",,
L. Lin,1.0,"I did not have a good experience. The atmosphere was consistently negative, and it felt as though she thrived on making students feel inadequate.",,
Z. Ma,4.3,"genuinely such a kind and nice professor, very relaxed and very willing to help with any questions/assignments even exams! its impossible to get a low grade in his class, as long as you do your assignments and he even gives extensions if you need. go to his office hours just to chat or ask questions and hes always there to help :]",Very hard to understand for first couple weeks. He often goes on tangents that have nothing to do with course material. He often comes unprepared and disorganized to lecture. He is a very easy grader and is an easy A. He will basically give you answers to the test if you ask him questions. Lectures are just reading off slides for 1he 20min.,Professor Joao Marum was awesome. His lectures are fairly easy and the professor also is very funny and always tries to make its lectures interesting and fun!
Y. Zheng,3.4,"Overall you can tell he is very knowledgeable about the topics and cares about the material. It is very test heavy, but tests mirror homework rather closely, making studying straightforward. Vyer interesting material.","He's super nice and his power points are pretty good, but his class is super test heavy which makes it hard to get a good grade if you aren't a good test taker.","Professor Zheng's slides are clear, and his study plans would prepare you well with the exam."
P. Yung,4.9,"For BME students, Prof. Yung is one of the best faculty in the department! His course is fun and engaging. For those new to BME it introduces you to a little of everything- programming, CAD, and medical knowledge. There is group and individual work, and outside of that there are many extra credit opportunities. He also does online + in person help.","Yung taught ECS 101 for the first time this semester. He constantly took feedback from students (and applied it) and structured the class so that we were learning to understand, not to pass an exam. After exam 1 he offered a reflection assignment to boost your exam grade. During his office hours he's helped with assignments and getting into a lab.","Professor Young is my favorite professor at Syracuse. He is very caring, gives great feedback, and wants his students to succeed. I've taken almost all the classes Professor Young offers and was happy with every single one."
Y. Wu,3.5,"professor is great, extremely kind and exams aren't hard",Lecture contents can be totally self-studied.,"Insensitive to student needs, he always tell students to think of our own problems"
C. Smith,2.4,"She's super nice but is a tough grader. She has strict guidelines for how your code should look and has no exceptions for late work. The group projects can also be quite difficult with no prior coding experience, but ask her for help! Random quizzes are her way of taking attendance, but they're not that hard. No exams.",takes pop quizzes everyday based off of attendance. lectures are rly boring and reads off slides. little to no instructions on projects but they are easy overall. shes a nice professor but is rly bad at instructions and giving help.,Read off slides all class and was not forgiving for late work or small mistakes.
K. Tsokas,4.3,"Collins is an absolutely incredible professor. I had him for two semesters in a row, and I am incredibly sad that I cannot take any more classes with him. Collins deeply cares about his material, and he wants you to care about it as well. He is a tough grader, but he always provides good feedback to improve for the next paper.","I'm a 4.0 high school student. Lost all interest in school. After 5 semesters of going through the motions, Collins gave me a reason to be excited for school. Nothing he teaches is easy to understand, nor is it compelling material. However, his knowledge and willingness to be personable is a strength. He will leave you WANTING to read more.",He best professor
E. Jain,1.0,"Worst experience I've ever had with a prof. Had no idea what she was doing & wouldn't respond to student's feedback. Most dry lectures ever. The class had a lab component, and it consistently went over time. Spent an extra 3 hours in the lab one week because she had not prepared for it. Grade weighting made no sense also. Horrible experience.","Horrible. Not receptive to students' feedback. Refused to give us our exams back to review for the final. Dry lecturer, would also waste class waiting for students to respond to questions we never learned. She kept us for an extra hour after our 3 hour lab ended. We all told her we didn't understand anything and did nothing to improve.",
D. Ren,4.0,"""The professor is pretty average, but his teaching makes the course harder than it needs to be. He doesn't post slides, so you're stuck relying on your own notes. The tests are ridiculously hard, often covering details barely mentioned in class. Luckily, he offers extra credit, which can save your ass if you bomb a test—so take advantage of it.""","I personally found this class particularly easy and interesting. There are many court cases to memorize, but it's not bad. He allows cheat sheets on the tests. He does not call on people for participation—it is all slides, but still interesting regardless. He does not post the slides. Typing is the best way to take notes (there is a lot to copy).",
M. Monroe,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
J. Hewett,2.7,"You're only graded by exams, but overall the course itself is very dense and difficult. He kind of just reads off the slides but will explain if you ask.",Wow toxicology was really hard. Dr. Hewett is very knowledgeable but it's hard to keep up with him sometimes. His tests are difficult because almost every question is short response rather than multiple choice. Your grade depends almost entirely on the tests so there is no room for error. Don't take this unless you know you can put in the work.,"Professor Hewett is passionate about his work, but the lectures are dense and he is unable to boil concepts down simply. Graded only by tests and the occasional homework assignment. The tests are majority short answer and involve outside knowledge. The lectures are hard to follow due to superficial information and lack of explanation."
Staff,4.7,"Professor Stafford is by far one of my favorites at this university. He fills classes with humor and enjoys connecting personally with each student as they permit. Grading is most strict when it comes to your formatting and citations. Aside from that, you have nothing to worry about. He gives you plenty of time for each paper, so use that wisely","Stafford was my favorite professor super funny guy who always made class fly by super quick, he prefers quality over when you get the paper done which is super helpful to be able to take more time into actually writing a good paper instead of rushing through it because of the due date LOVE this guy best English prof you will ever have","He is hilarious! Professor Stafford is very nice, always asking about our day and offering guidance. He is a very sarcastic person. There are few papers and we spend a lot of our time critiquing them. The reading and journals we write on the reading is also very simple. No quizzes. Great class!"
J. Jok,2.0,"Goes on tangents. Everything gets retaught by TA in section. Bad TA = bad grade. He seems checked out a lot of the time. Nice guy, but hard to digest class.","In the beginning, I enjoyed the lectures as I found learning about other cultures interesting. The part that rubbed me the wrong way was how he talked and depicted women and the Military. Trigger warning for SA survivors regarding video he did not give one. Exams are hard as anything can be on it.","Jok Jok goes on tangents a lot of the time and sometimes it can be difficult to understand the point he's trying to get across. He's very stern. If you take this class be prepared to be miserable for an entire semester, because his expectations are unrealistic."
S. Run,3.8,"DO not take this class over summer extremely hard!! more than half the class dropped out, much better to take during regular semesters. A lot of material very fast paced.","Runyon is awesome. He gives u hw out of the text n u grade u'rself,he just checks for completeness, n the labs are easy to follow n he's extremely helpfull, lectures are boring but stick with it. If you have the motivation u'll like him cuzz he's easy going n helpfull... n once in a while in class wen u'r dossing off, he brings in liq nitrogen n st","Goes into detail when he has time. Posts his lectures online and packets to helps prepare for exams. There is a quiz every monday but they are fairly easy if you study and understand it, worth 20 points. There are 2 parts to the exam, multiple choice and short answer. I recommend this teacher if you want to understand chemistry. Easy to talk to."
R. Wang,2.4,One of the most boring classes I have ever taken during my time at university. Class does not relate to the course description and would never have taken that class if I knew what I was getting into. Avoid her.,"Professor Wang was very knowledgeable and interested in the subject matter, and though she tried her best to make the subject matter interesting, I feel she often fell short. She wasn't a hard grader, but her assignment instructions were vague, and she didn't provide helpful feedback or clarifications on what she expected in your final product.",HOM165 was not the most interesting class but an easy humanities course as long as you do the weekly textbook reviews and study the lecture slides for exams. There are 3 exams that are very detail orientated based on very insignificant material from the lecture. The study guides are word for word for the short response section but nothing else.
V. Raina,3.0,"Professor Raina is a great professor that really cares about her students and their learning experience. This was the second time she had taught immunology, so she made sure to ask for feedback. Her blackboard wasn't organized which was the most frustrating part of the class but if she can figure that out in the future, she is a 10/10 professor.","Took this professor for Molecular Biotechnology. This professor is lazy, will not explain her grading and her blackboard is a MESS. She will not explicitly say if there is a rubric and will not be straightforward about assignments. She also constantly complains about grading but assigns so much work. If you can avoid taking her class I suggest it!!","Dr. Raina is awesome. She wants her students succeed + gets to know her students. I have taken 3 courses from her, so I've figured out what works. She says you don't have to read the textbook but I would bc it helps with understanding the material. Also MEMORIZE THE STUDY GUIDE! The class is test heavy and her questions come from the guide."
H. Ruffin,2.2,ruffin is extremely knowledgeable BUT he will make you do things that are not even graded. had the class do 3 essays for the final and did not even grade them in time. this class is extremely unorganized and will still stress you out,He is a guy who loves to talk but rarely about information needed for this course. There is no organized system or curriculum just a list of topics that are touched on throughout the course of the year. There is no homework but the two only exams in the course are graded unfairly and strictly. I would not take course if you care about your gpa.,"gives an incrediable amount of readings that are almost useless for any class material. Gives barely any homework all year long, gives a 2 paragraph midterm than slaps you in the face with a minimum of a 4 page final essay. he has knowledge in AAS but has zero engery and will put you to sleep in lecture."
P. Emerson,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her. She is a great teacher, but confusing. You should go over her power point and do homework problems and you will receive an A."
B. Hinkley,2.8,Brief introduction.,Useless knowledge. Inexplicable homework. Only TA helpful,1-Knowledgeable professor 2-Everyweek quiz and homework and those cause you to be prepared for exams 3-Helpful professor 4-Provide opportunities for extra scores with extra assignments 5-Good experience 6-I suggest you to get the course
E. Whitaker,3.0,One of the worst courses & professors I've had at TWU. Beyond frustrating that this course is ONLY taught by her & is required for the degree plan. I take her class online & the way she has Canvas structured is very messy and confusing. Beware if you take this course online you HAVE to show your work by scanning in your test problems.,"Please do not take this professor! She is honestly the worst professor I have taken. Her lectures are extremely confusing. She jumps from problems and pulls examples out of her head. She also ""teaches"" extremely fast and does not slow down. The majority of students in our class are failing and she does not care. Save your GPA and DO NOT take her!!",Worst professor here. It is extremely unfortunate that she's the only one teaching this REQUIRED course. You'll need to purchase the book which she CONSISTENTLY says NOT to refer to because you basically need to do the math her way. Huge waste of money.. you're looking to pay 150 just to access the hw. At least hw is due at the end of the course?
K. Singh,5.0,"Jags was a solid professor. His lectures were boring but the content was interesting. The class was overall not very hard. If you participate then you'll do very good. His tests are open note, online, and at home. However, the exams are super hard for no reason. Just show up, participate, do the homework and you'll do just fine.",One of the best professors I've had at SU. He presents the material in a really clear way and encourages class discussion. He makes students feel super comfortable sharing their opinions and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot in his class and it made me a better person. Highly highly recommend.,Rating is for PHI 245 Philosophy of Sports. Great teacher and class would def recommend. The exams are online open note. Not a lot of homework at all takes a very short amount of time. You need to participate in class to get credit.
F. Keles,4.4,"He was awesome, really engaging and loves what he teaches. He responds to emails within literally 2 hours no matter what. Assignments were so easy. Quizzes throughout the semester but the questions are given out at beginning of semester. So easy, if you literally just show up youll get an A.","AMAZING PROF 10/10 highly recommend. Genuinely cares about his students and the lectures are interesting. Some classes are lectures and discussion, sometimes you watch an interesting movie, or you may learn more about anthology internationally and nationally. Nicest guy","Absolutely wonderful Professor! If I am being honest, I did not like both him and his teaching style for the first 2 weeks, but he definitely grew on me. Truly passionate about teaching and and the course material. The grade was mostly made up of 4 reports with a few minor assignments scattered about such as pop quizzes and participation grades."
G. Pezzarossi,3.6,"Overloads too much information in slides, unclear instructions on different parts of course like the map and readings (which were supposed to be uploaded every week) ended being uploaded around the 6th week -- so had to end up writing a lot of things on very short notice. Not a good experience.",I love Guido. He helped me out when I was struggling and made this class a safe place. He's so sweet and passionate about what he teaches. Everyone should take a class with him!,"I was not the biggest. I found his lectures to be so boring and the exam questions to be very specific and not for an intro class. The TA grades everything and was decently lenient. The readings were SO long, but not too needed for the exams but would come up some."
F. Jones,4.8,"Easygoing, friendly and class content is easy to understand. Has papers due throughout semester papers where research is needed. Homework is usually short response question or prompt given at the end of class.",Such an interesting class. This was a requirement for the HFS major and it was super fun to take with her. Going to take another class with her next semester!,"Prof. Jones is the best!! Most interesting class I have taken yet at Syracuse. She is super nice, understanding, and makes lectures enjoyable. Highly recommend as a fun elective."

J. Haines,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"
K. Johnson,2.0,MGT 462 (was not listed)- All she does is lectures and the HW are all based on the lecture slides. The exams aren't bad but you do need to study since it was 50 questions all multiple choice. You also have to complete a project. It wasn't a bad class just annoying.,Tammy Johnson teaches about accountability yet refused to take accountability when she lost the attendance sheet and gave everyone -4 attendance points. She is incredibly boring and her homework and tests feel almost impossible to get 100% on.,
D. Okanlawon,5.0,Great Professor!,,
A. Burnside,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
M. Bhan,4.3,"She's really good at explaining things. Her lecture is interesting. Her homework was easy, you only need to read and reflect. No exams or quizzes. No essays. There are group projects.","Bhan was great! If you need an IDEA and writing intensive take this class. Super easy essays and material, no tests so you dont actually have to copy her slides if you dont want but they do help with the weekly commentary great TAs for the class too!","I actually took ANT185 and I'd recommend it because it counts as a writing intensive! Prof Bhan is extremely smart and helpful. Her lectures are engaging, and you really don't have to attend them since there are no exams, and the weekly commentaries are based only on the readings. Super interesting niche topics that I never thought I'd explore."
J. Sharma,2.4,"As much as I really didn't enjoy the course, this prof had nothing to do with that. She clearly understood the material and was very helpful to all students both during class and had flexible office hours. This was super important as most of the course was a group project that was presented during the last few weeks of the course. Overall, not bad.",Class required mandatory attendance since iclicker was a large part of the mark. Very difficult to ask her questions -- shuts you down as if you know nothing and speaks to you in a degrading tone. Exams require a lot of detail especially for a GAS course. She wants authors name and era. 8/10 would not recommend her classes.,"Boring, inconclusive. Forced you to take notes (and grade them) in the most useless format possible: had to redo my notes twice for every reading because of this system. Tutorial classes consisted of the T.A. spoon feeding the international students like it was fourth grade."
K. Taylor Riccio,3.6,"I really liked Politics of Russia. The class was interesting, and Professor Taylor was super entertaining. He always starts his class with a random Russian music video and he does two truths and a lie for each student. There are a lot of textbooks, and the final essay is tough, but the class is pretty easy as long as you show up.",The fact I don't agree with Taylor on a good few things and still really enjoy his class is a testament to what a good professor he is. Very passionate about his work and extremely funny at times in class. Class is test heavy and you're graded on few things but if you do the readings and show up to class you'll do well.,I absolutely recommend that you do not take any of his classes. Smart guy. Loves himself. Insecure. Boring. Inconsistent grader. Steer clear.

M. Schwarz,2.6,"Textbook is required to do the HW. Tests are curved, and there is a study guide given before each exam. Lab was my least fav part of class (only submit 1 report, so 1 person ends up doing all the work). Lecture is long/confusing. No calculators on test, and helpful to have prior phy knowledge coming in. Not great at science still got an A.",She is the worst professor I have taken in 3 years being in this school. She clearly doesn't know what she is teaching to students and exams are extremely hard for being 101 class.,"She is an extremely smart woman, but has no idea how to teach. She rushes through problems and her lectures are disorganized and hard to follow. The TAs are the only good part about the class. Maybe good for higher level class, but her lower level class is way too hard. The exams are impossible. She curves because all her students fail."
K. Oda,3.7,"Not a good professor. The class was comprised mainly of student presentations and he lectured a total of 4-5 times the semester. On top of that, the lectures are verbatim from the textbook, so it is very repetitive and boring. I would not suggest taking this professor.","Adjusts workload as needed and gives extensions if you ask ahead of time. Explains and demonstrates concepts clearly. Grades assignments based on accuracy, but grades slowly so expect them to return late. Funny and engaging prof.","Attending class isn't mandatory, but professor gave extra credit for the students who actually showed up to class and recitation. Content is not too difficult, as long as you go to your recitation and lectures, exams are pretty easy and similar to recitation activities. Would recommend to take for humanities credit. 2 exams, one project, and final."
A. Hromadzic Vlasak,4.4,She is a great teacher and cares a lot about her students. She will spend the time to get to know your name and information about you if you come to optional events or participate regularly in class. She makes the lectures interesting and understandable. There are weekly readings you need to at least skim. I would highly recommend her class.,Her lecture is nice and easy to understand. Also helpful outside the class. Slides on the blackboard lack many information than the lecture.TA are not good cuz the weird grading criteria,"I loved her so much, she was so cute. But I HATED my TA, he gave me a good grade (a 97) on my first essay and gave me a sense of false confidence. He proceeded to give me low B's on the next two for no reason! Class is fairly easy but make sure you go to class because she doesn't post slideshows."
T. Singleton,1.9,"By far the worst professor I've had at Syracuse. If you have the option, take this class with someone else. Lectures were useless, office hours didn't help, and the only way to pass was to read the book and teach yourself everything. The exams were fair but way too hard considering how unprepared we all were.","The worst econ professor I've ever had at Syracuse. You will not learn anything and you will have to teach yourself for exams. There's no point in going to lectures. TA's can't even help and office hours are useless. If you can take another professor for this class, do yourself a favor and do it. If not, get a tutor or find a genius. Good luck!",He is so quite when teaching and he just thinks that we know everything
R. Habib,1.0,Had to take her for my minor and shes so boring. Literally not even approachable and she one of the worst teacher I ever had. She is not helpful and very rude. don't take her,,
R. Rubinstein,3.0,"I will never forget leaving after the third exam. Standing face to face I told Prof. Rubinstein, ""thank you professor"" and he completely ignored me while looking into my eyes. Not only were the lectures almost always about his life and not the content we learned, but the Exams were almost impossible to pass. Many students felt the same way.",Random tiny facts from readings and jokes made in lecture that you don't think you have to take notes on will be on the test... The class average for our second exam was a 70% and the professor refused to curve it. There are 2-3 readings a week with 15-36 pages each AND an entire book you have to read and write 3 papers on in the discussion section,"Professor Rubinstein is very knowledgeable and experienced. While he may occasionally make uncomfortable remarks, he cares about his students and tries to do right by them. Those who ask for help will receive it without hesitation. If you put in the work and take it seriously, you will do well."
D. Larsen,3.1,"He has pop quizzes and pop homework assignments. If you miss class or are late to take the pop quiz, you can't make these up. He doesn't set reminders for tests or projects that are due in class. Still, he knows what he's talking about and will try to make the class as interesting as possible. Cool class overall.",Overall good professor and not a difficult class.,Larsen reaches this class as if it were an upper level instead of a 1000 level class. I feel like he purposely makes it harder which is ridiculous because this class is a gen ed. The class is extremely boring and all he does is read from PowerPointIf you can take anyone else Id highly suggest you avoid Larsen at all costs!
K. Mallon Andrews,2.7,All grades and feedback come from the TA. Grades were not updated frequently. Had her for anthropology 111.,Went to every class for ANT 111 and it didn't help,"Absolutely lovely teacher and person, a highly intelligent woman who is clear and fair with grades. Highly recommend."
C. DeCorse,3.9,"This class was pretty easy but so so so boring, do not take it unless you need it for your major. He posts slideshows of lectures after class but they have almost zero information on them so you have to attend lecture to learn anything. The tests were easy if you studied based off the study guides, lecture notes and textbook.",he seems great but i was genuinely so confused and bored the whole time. i thought i was going to enjoy this class but i really did not and i had no idea what was going on no matter how much i studied. like i just cannot emphasize how confused i was the whole time. also the blackboard was a mess which gave me a headache.,"Eh, I didn't really enjoy this class but if you need it to fulfill a credit it's easy enough. DeCorse was a nice guy, tbh I rarely attended lectures but when I did I was pretty bored. He posts the lectures but you won't get much info from them so you should prob go to lecture as much as you can. Three exams(study guide helps)and no papers."
J. Medjo Me Biomo,1.6,"Get ready to do lots of work for little credit. For my 1 credit lab course, every week we were expected to do a reading and a prelab before the lab session. Then, in the lab session you have to complete the ENTIRE thing before the time is over otherwise you will lose points. Have a question? He will be extremely passive aggressive and not help you.","CSE 397: He did not try new labs before assigning them. Wasted weeks on simple problems. But here's the nasty twist... I learned a ton. You will be on your own with this man. He will kick you into a deep hole, but should you get angry enough to climb out of it, you will find yourself suddenly wrapped in extreme proficiency. Opinion extremely mixed.","Don't. Just don't. Exams are 96% of your grade with grading so harsh that one small mistake wipes out nearly all points. No partial credit, no clear criteria. Half the class withdrew, and most of the rest are failing This isn't just a tough class—it's a disaster. Avoid this professor if you value your GPA or your sanity."
J. Waclawski,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck.

Y. Tang,3.0,"CSE 384: Above all, I really respect Professor Tang. His class focusses on learning through practice, which is something a lot of other professors could take a lesson from. Occasionally it can be hard to understand what he's saying in class, but he's very welcoming to questions and usually gets it right on the 2nd go. Tests are straightforward.","CSE 384 Grade: 50% HW, 25% midterm, 25% final Tang is a really frustrating teacher. His lectures and homework assignments are easy enough to understand and do, nothing too bad. The issue are the exams. The difficulty spike is ridiculous, requiring extreme detail to do well, especially since each exam is worth 25% of your final grade.","I learned a lot from this course, I would take his course again!"
Y. Cao,3.0,"Shi not that hard ngl. He says that u should read the textbook, but I didn't read a single page and I was chillin. The midterm and final was VERY fair. The study guide he gave for both HEAVILY reflects the test. HW was easy, if you use your resources. A 55% is a C and a 70% is a B-, but the 2 tests made up for 70% of your grade. HW costed hella tho",super sweet prof. if you don't understand lectures then ochem tutor vids got you. go to arc tutoring and office hours for help. do practice problems often. study the microtutorial problems. study for midterm and final. if you actually put good effort into this class you will get an A.,"One of the worst professors i've had in my two years in ucr. Class was very hard because it was mostly based on difficult exams. The average was around 50%, and he didn't curve. There were few chances to raise your grade with assignments.

J. Medjo Me Biomo",1.6,"Get ready to do lots of work for little credit. For my 1 credit lab course, every week we were expected to do a reading and a prelab before the lab session. Then, in the lab session you have to complete the ENTIRE thing before the time is over otherwise you will lose points. Have a question? He will be extremely passive aggressive and not help you.","CSE 397: He did not try new labs before assigning them. Wasted weeks on simple problems. But here's the nasty twist... I learned a ton. You will be on your own with this man. He will kick you into a deep hole, but should you get angry enough to climb out of it, you will find yourself suddenly wrapped in extreme proficiency. Opinion extremely mixed.","Don't. Just don't. Exams are 96% of your grade with grading so harsh that one small mistake wipes out nearly all points. No partial credit, no clear criteria. Half the class withdrew, and most of the rest are failing This isn't just a tough class—it's a disaster. Avoid this professor if you value your GPA or your sanity."
E. Ercanli,3.2,"Zybook reading, exams, pop quizzes, blackboard assignments. Work to understand core theoretical concepts and you will be able to handle problems he throws. TA probably useless due to highly variable nature of computer architectures; too subjective. Have casual class conversations with professor. He's funny, caring, and passionate about this field.",great for grade,Terrible class. Wouldn't have taken the course if it was not a core course
"D. Marcy
D. Marcy",3.7,"Mr. Marcy is a professor who clearly grew up with the technology that he's teaching. We learned the history, physics, and logic of semi-conductor devices, using FPGA boards and VHDL hardware design language for lab. For the last project, we implemented a primitive CPU based on Intel's original CPU (4004). Friday lab sucks, but he made it fun!","He's very knowledgeable of what he teaches and is more than willing to help you understand or troubleshoot a problem you're having. Having a strong coding background is really nice to have for this class. The class is very hands-on, it's crucial you try to understand what you're trying to accomplish. Overall, one of the best professors at SU.","Amazing professor. Really loves his field and is such a modernized professor. Very accessible outside of class, patient, and knowledgeable. If you are an engineer, definitely take his classes. It can be challenging but with the right group and dedicated hours after class, it is not impossible to pass. A blessing to Syracuse University!"
B. Kim,2.8,Brief introduction.,Useless knowledge. Inexplicable homework. Only TA helpful,1-Knowledgeable professor 2-Everyweek quiz and homework and those cause you to be prepared for exams 3-Helpful professor 4-Provide opportunities for extra scores with extra assignments 5-Good experience 6-I suggest you to get the course
J. Graham,3.7,"Dr. Graham made this class pretty easy to understand. She would handwrite the notes with us, making it easy to follow along. The homework assignments can be long and starting them a day or two before they are due is a good idea. The exams are difficult and cover a lot of content but she prepares you well for them. I recommend Dr. Graham.","Dr. Graham was a good teacher. She was able to communicate the topics effectively but the layout of the class was a bit weird. We would have to read the textbook, do hw that was worth 25% of our grade, then we would come to class and she would teach what the hw was on, then we would have to submit a group project.",Easy professor. Easiest A for a freshman class. Just do the work because there are only a few and they matter. Easy exams.
L. Wang,2.4,One of the most boring classes I have ever taken during my time at university. Class does not relate to the course description and would never have taken that class if I knew what I was getting into. Avoid her.,"Professor Wang was very knowledgeable and interested in the subject matter, and though she tried her best to make the subject matter interesting, I feel she often fell short. She wasn't a hard grader, but her assignment instructions were vague, and she didn't provide helpful feedback or clarifications on what she expected in your final product.",HOM165 was not the most interesting class but an easy humanities course as long as you do the weekly textbook reviews and study the lecture slides for exams. There are 3 exams that are very detail orientated based on very insignificant material from the lecture. The study guides are word for word for the short response section but nothing else.
"J. Weissman
J. Weissman",3.4,"I have never had a professor that thinks it is acceptable to shove their political beliefs down your throat like her. I am well aware I took a class about law, but as a professor in a private college, beyond me that she has not yet gotten in trouble for only talking about one sides views and making the other side feel uncomfortable in her class.",Great professor!! Super caring and passionate about criminal justice.,"Professor Weissman is passionate about and very knowledgeable about the topics discussed in class. Although her lectures may not always be the most engaging, they are very interesting, and she often brings in guest speakers who relate to the topics. If you take notes and show up, it's an easy A. I would definitely take class with her again."
"M. Abdallah
M. Abdallah",5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
"Staff

He's always available to support students, and his dedication is commendable. Highly recommend him as an educator who genuinely cares about his students' success.","I sometimes wonder why SCI has such high tuition, but then I check the course listing and am reminded of the hard work that Staff has to put in daily and realize its all worth it . I feel bad for Staff, feels unfair that almost every course is taught by him. Hopefully Pitt changes that soon","t's amazing that staff somehow manages to teach a class at the same time on the same day multiple days a week for multiple classes. When I was scheduling I literally couldn' t find a better professor to take. Definetley didn't like how unpredictable professor's exams, criteria, and assignments are. Good Luck, you definetley will have to take staff."
"G. Wagner
G. Wagner",5.0,Professor Wagner is full of energy and love of law. I was so scared to take Communications Law but she made it as painless as possible and actually enjoyable.

Confusing directions, has an attitude when you ask for clarity. Tells stories instead of teaching. All of our classmates agree that she's not","Professor Wagner is responsive and interacts with her students well. Textbook material is easy to understand and relatable. As long as you complete all assignments, you will do well in the class."
N. Ghani,4.2,the goat fr,"Super nice! I had zero coding experience and was able to excel in his class. It can be hard as first, but you catch on quick!! He's funny, he truly cares about his students, and he gives great feedback during labs (which are very relaxed). Attendance is not mandatory in lectures (but you should go!)",rly nice professor he seems like he really cares about the students. labs are worth a lot of ur grade so def get them done. midterm/final is exactly like the lab too. there is a textbook that works with the homework but the textbook is free.
"S. Roueche
S. Roueche",4.3,"He is a really nice and friendly professor. He genuinely cares about his students. He is more concerned about you understanding the concepts, and he doesn't grade harshly. He has reasonable expectations for assignments and exams. He is easy to talk to and he is quite understanding. I recommend taking any of his courses, including CSE 687.","Really nice guy. Cares more about people getting concepts than grades, so assignments could even be turned in after solutions were sent out. It's an easy, laid back course. He did a decent job with lectures, but wasn't very responsive via email and didn't give much feedback on assignments. I respect him, but would appreciate being challenged more.","A nice person but I wouldn't say I learned enough programming knowledge from this class compared to Baruch's sections. He really doesn't care about students so the class is a lot easier but less informative than Baruch's class. If you just want to pass then choose him, but if CS is your major, then don't choose adjunct professor."
Q. Qiu,1.9,"Worst professor i ever had, never pick any of her classes unless you are Chinese student because she values only Chinese student and tries her best to let all other students down as much as she can, avoid her forever if you want to succeed.","Unclear Instructions throughout the course for Lab, Project.","Nice, intelligent lady but a terrible professor."
M. Hoque,4.7,Professor knows a lot about what he is talking and he is very passionate. He goes a little fast but that is due to too many contents in the course. He gives you chances to recover your grade. Reach out if you need help and go to lab. Make sure to go to class since there are quizzes sometimes. His course is the most organized in my experience.,The professor has very clear criteria for grading. This course was the most well organized course taken at SU so far. You will learn a lot about low level programming and operating system kernel if you pay attention. Professor and the TA is very caring and is veru flexible. There are labs which prepare you to finish project. Exams are doable.,"Being a master student and not having CS background, I was able to understand and keep up with the course content. The pop-up quizzed used to scare me..but just focus on that day's lecture it should be good. The professor is very clear about course organization and expectation. Exams are hard but he gives a review ..don't miss it"
"Staff
J. Spencer",3.6,"Prof Spencer is a nice, grandfatherly guy who is very knowledgeable and passionate about forensics. His lectures will put you to sleep but the tests are take-home and open note so that's a guaranteed high grade. Even if you don't show up to lecture (but you should because he's just sweet), you'll still do well.",I LOVE PROF SPENCER! He was so funny in lectures and you can tell that he truly cares about what he does. He's such an amazing man and I wish I could take all of my classes with him. PLEASE do yourself a favor and take one of his courses he will truly brighten your week,"His lectures can be boring at times, but he can also be kinda funny and he provides a lot of material in them. Grading is based on tests, which are online, and labs. Labs are poorly put together and often have changes when you get there, but they can be pretty fun and don't actually take the full three hours."
J. French,4.4,"French really cares about his students and will go out of his way to help anyone who asks for it. He was able to make a challenging course simple and has a great grading scale that allows you to still achieve high grades if you get C averages on exams. He encourages participation, and posts lectures so you can review whatever you missed in class.",Explains things clear and simple. Lots of homework. A great and funny professor who is great at chem.,AMAZING. If you do all the work given you will succeed in the class. Very understanding and nice. He is funny and makes the class engaging. If you have to take chem choose FRENCH!!!
P. Dent,4.7,Professor Denti was amazing. She is one of the best professors I have had. Only 4 tests and she does an extra credit paper. If you go to class and write down what she says (she tells you what slides off of the powerpoint you need) then it is an easy A!,"She is the best professor in SU. Well made powerpoint, good explanations, lots of examples and activities that help us to understand. 4 exams are truly easy when you read powerpoint well.

Goes super fast in lectures, not the most helpful in office hours, and your only grades are exams and homework, so it's hard to do well. Lecture/recitation aren't mandatory but it's impossible to keep up if you don't go","I think the school should revaluate its tenured professors. The practice exams are useless. If you use them, she doesn't release the answers so you may not know if you're correct or not. How are we suppose to learn if we don't even know what our mistakes were. Lectures are straight up read off the slides. Go to recitation, TAs are better.","Totah is ones of the best Chemistry Professors here at Syracuse, especially for organic chemistry.

He's always very involved and enthusiastic during class and I really enjoyed going to his lectures. He also gives group work assignments and PyMOL homeworks which are helpful to improve your grade. Overall I think he's an excellent professor.,"I agree that his exams are misleading compared to what he emphasizes in class, but Biochem isn't a hard enough class where that should matter; if you know the material the way you are supposed to versus memorizing everything it doesn't matter what is or isn't on the exams. He listens to student concerns and addresses them appropriately."

Only grades are a few homework assignments and exams so study a lot for the exams. The exams are very similar to the practice exams and they are pretty fair.,"Don't get me wrong, Professor Chisholm is very educated on the topic but teaches as if Organic Chemistry is common sense.

During class, he will open discussion but only call on the same 2 people every time. He also says 1 lie during every lecture, expecting you to know what it is, so you have no idea what is and isn't true. He's a very tough grader and does not accommodate."

Fraser,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing.

K. Nisenbaum,2.4,"She is brilliant & amiable. Learned a lot, but this class isn't for the weak. It's theory-heavy with 4-5 complex weekly readings (20-30+ pages each), but she breaks down concepts well. Doesn't give much direction on papers. If you ever get an A, which isn't easy, it won't be higher than a 94 or 95. Lovely lady but refuses to give 100s on anything.",Horrible class and prof,"I took this class to have an easy elective. This class was strange and hard. Exams were all handwritten and lots of content. Nothing we learned made sense and she assigned so many readings. Participation matters. You also have 2 essays. I didn't come to class on occasion and I hardly spoke, but my essay & exam grades carried me to an A."

M. Rozas Arceo,2.5,"Her lectures were difficult to understand and unorganized. She gives out at least 7 assignments per week and there is no rubric for them. You wouldn't know what she's looking for in your answers, like how long they should be or how much detail you need to put it until after she grades them and deducts points on your submission.","This class has been the most unorganized and confusing class Ive taken at UNF. She is a nice person but the class itself is very frustrating. Doesnt answer all emails, always changing class plans, made us buy a book only to use it once, never properly explains how were supposed to do assignments, most of class felt like a waste of time.",
P. Ryan,4.5,"one of the BEST ECN prof in SU, nice person with huge knowledge base. Dont expect the course will be easy, its a 400-level class. Mainly study in model and graph, do not require a lot of math. Study hard, the n you get A.","Super nice, passionate and knows what he's teaching. Tests are kinda hard so need to study but material isn't impossible. Grade determined by 5 HW's based on effort/completion, 3 easy writing assignments based on a podcast and 3 tests. Grading scale helps a lot (85 = A, 70 = B). It's what you'd expect of an upper level class and I would recommend.",
J. Lee,1.1,"Moon seems to have knowledge of course content, but 0 teaching ability or execution. She makes up assignments on the spot (tons of busywork) and grades harshly without ANY feedback. She makes you work really hard to understand her instructions and grading rationale, then doesn't uphold what she said. Queen of loopholes and unethical behavior.","I had her for two classes, and this one began my avoidance of her. She can't explain things, and forces you to learn the content on your own. The entire class was a group project, and the only reason why my group bonded was our mutual disdain of her. If you want to learn, avoid her and take classes with any other PR professor.","This was my second class with her, and it was as terrible as I remembered. For an ethics course, she struggled to even explain the basic ethical concepts and it took me so long to grasp. I was one of the few participants in the class, and I felt like I was forced to participate. Avoid her for your own sanity: she drove me insane twice."
K. Richardson,3.6,This professor is very strict and calls people out for the littlest things. Her lectures and readings are so confusing and everyone I know wishes they dropped this class when they had the chance.,"Prof. Richardson is a great prof, very knowledgeable and smart. Don't need to buy books, readings were on Blackboard or easily accessible on Google. Only need to submit five 1-2 page assignments out of the ten possible. She gives you the 3 tests a week beforehand, so you should go into the tests completely prepared. You learn from the lectures.","Presents ideas clearly and from both sides. Do NOT use phones in class, docks half letter grades after being caught twice. Gives exactly what's going to be on the midterm and final beforehand. Lectures are pretty straightforward to the point where you rarely need to read the assignments."
M. Rieppel,3.7,Class was easy. Only two quizzes.,Decent lecturer. All lectures are just reading off slides. Is good at clearly explaining philosophy concepts. Attendance is taken randomly via QR Code at end of class.,"really nice guy teaching really hard stuff. sometimes it doesn't translate, but he is always accessible for questions. not doing the readings will mean a hard time for you in the classroom."
S. Alvarez,4.9,I really liked this class and would recommend it to anyone who's planning to take an English 110 class. This professor is really nice and enthusiastic about what he teaches.,Brilliant! He knows his stuff and it translates well through his engaging (and funny) lectures. The workload is quite heavy but worth it in the end. You'll learn a lot. Yay!,"He is a great professor, very down to earth. There are 3 essays that are very easy. If you go to class everytime and pay attention, you will do fine. There is reading from the textbook, but I found the reading interesting and not boring. He is a nice, normal, and fun professor who gets everyone interested in the lessons."
T. Pan,3.2,"This is probably the easiest class I am currently taking, that being said, you better not make eye contact with this man or you will be his main focus point for the rest of the semester. He cares a lot but assigns a ton of out of class readings and generates major assignments entirely with ChatGPT, not even bothering to proofread what he assigns.",He talks and talks and talks and talks,"Very nice teacher, easy class, show up to class"
J. Liebergen,4.8,LOVED THIS CLASS! My favorite class I've taken at Syracuse to date. Jared is so passionate about what he speaks on and encourages class participation. It is such an interesting class especially hearing everyone's perspectives. He gives you the exam a week before so you can prepare and know what you're being tested on. 10/10 totally recommend.,"I took PHI192. I had never taken a philosophy class before, but I did well and really liked it. Jared is awesome, super helpful- gives out test questions before the test, encourages participation, and will answer every question. He really cares. If you put in effort it's a relatively easy class, and interesting too","I took PHI 192. Super sweet guy. Goes into great detail about each topic and ensures that everyone understands. Reading assignments due every class (only need to do 10/15), 3 tests (literally gives you the test beforehand), and PARTICIPATION POINTS (he's pretty strict on participation but makes it easy for everyone to participate)."

H. Shirmohammadi,3.0,He grades everything and gives you feedback on what you got wrong and can fix. He uploads all the answer keys online after he grades then but you are graded on very few things.,,
W. Osborne III,4.5,"Loved her lectures, but as soon as she let other people talk they just wouldn't stop which would make classes sometimes unbearable. She is so intelligent and I wish she would just talk for the whole class because everything she says is so captivating. If you just take notes and study her study guides for exams you'll do well.","Professor Osborne is a kind, intelligent teacher. My complaint with the class is she encourages lot of student participation, which is often irrelevant, redundant, and causes us to get behind schedule. If you don't mind that though, lectures are fairly interesting. The only homework is a weekly online progress check which is a free 100%.","Kind person. She made COM 107 interesting and engaging, and was flexible. Really great professor, and she's the kind of person you want to maintain a connection with. She cares about her students. Grading: She gives the written sections of exams to the TA to grade, and that grading was a bit inconsistent. Also news quizzes - read the news! :)"

Y. Cimendereli,3.0,"Shi not that hard ngl. He says that u should read the textbook, but I didn't read a single page and I was chillin. The midterm and final was VERY fair. The study guide he gave for both HEAVILY reflects the test. HW was easy, if you use your resources. A 55% is a C and a 70% is a B-, but the 2 tests made up for 70% of your grade. HW costed hella tho",super sweet prof. if you don't understand lectures then ochem tutor vids got you. go to arc tutoring and office hours for help. do practice problems often. study the microtutorial problems. study for midterm and final. if you actually put good effort into this class you will get an A.,"One of the worst professors i've had in my two years in ucr. Class was very hard because it was mostly based on difficult exams. The average was around 50%, and he didn't curve. There were few chances to raise your grade with assignments. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR. With all due respect if you're happy with your mental health listen to me"
G. Lambert,5.0,"Dr. Lambert is clearly very passionate about WGS and her lectures were awesome! She encouraged class discussion and small group work, tried to make a big class feel very connected. There were a lot of readings every single day which were usually very dense, as well as frequent papers. Participate and pay attention during lectures, you will do well!",,
D. Morgan,4.6,Easy online class to take as long as you do all the quizzes and the discussions with responses due every week efficiently.,"Professor Morgan is engaging and holds very interesting lectures. Although lectures are not mandatory, the quizzes can sometimes have super lecture specific tricky questions. He is very reasonable and understanding with deadlines and course load. He is so knowledgable and just an overall amazing professor.","It is illogical to take any other professor when you have Morgan as an option. He is genuinely so funny, makes you feel seen in a big lecture, and it the material is so interesting. I had weekly homework quizzes and a few writing assignments but omg it was so so easy. Attendance isn't even mandatory but I still went any day"
H. Paakkunainen,4.2,"Approachable and caring and wants us to do well. do the hw, it's easy if you go to class (lowest 3 are dropped). Skill-focused 1 pagers are actually just a few lines. Only one essay at the end, quite easy (she likes precision and logical arguments over length) makes it easy for a non-major to understand philosophy concepts, love her!","Hille is super nice and truly cares. She definitely knows what she is talking about. Sometimes her lectures drag, and they do contain a lot of information, but, she posts them all on blackboard so if you missed something or don't feel like taking notes you can just look at them later. She will give random reading quizzes but they're 1 mc question.","Incredibly simple class. Just a few one-page papers, occasional 1 question reading quizzes, a final essay and a final test. Lectures aren't always the most exciting thing in the world, but they're not dreadful either. I don't see how anyone could justify failing this class."
M. Abreu Zavaleta,4.0,"He's a good professor. If you don't like math or never pass, come to him. He's Hispanic with a heavy accent but it's tolerable. Surprisingly knows his stuff, yk? It's a lot of online work on Pearson but we only took two TEN QUESTION tests and that's it. Attendance is mandatory and no phones. Not bad honestly. Just do what you have to do... wink.",,
J. Hunt,4.8,Josh was one of my favorite professors from last semester because he genuinely seemed to care about us as more than just a lecture hall. He learned every single persons name and allowed us to contribute to class as much or as little as we wanted. It's graded out of a point system so as long as you do the work you'll be fine.,"Josh Hunt is an excellent professor who clearly knows his subject matter and cares about the students in his class. Even though like 20 people in the entire lecture spoke up all semester, by midterms he knew everyones name which was impressive. THe class structure is great - completely open note exams and easy weekly online quizzes.",Josh is one of the coolest and most enthusiastic teachers I have ever met. the course is reading heavy you have take home quizzes and open-note midterm and final exam. The course is accessible to all and you can't fail even if you tired to. Josh remembered everyone's name in his big lecture and all the students felt encouraged and respected.
W. Bradley,4.0,"Absolutely would die for Professor Gorham! I did not miss a single lecture because they were so incredibly interesting. I loved everything about this course, but Professor Gorham truly makes the class so special.","Race and Gender in Sports Media... easy class. Everyone leads their own discussion. A few other assignments besides that. One easy exam. Took FOREVER to grade. But as long as you do a decent job, you'll end up with a good grade.","He took YEARS to grade our exams. Attendance at lectures isn't mandatory but if you go to he YAPS the whole time then we were two weeks behind in content. Quizzes are easy but he canceled half of them. He also pushed an entire project out for two weeks. Exams were in person closed note, but every other COM107 had open. Get ready to study."
K. Edwards,4.0,Great inspiring professor. The class is interesting if you like Philosophy. You will never leave a conversation wishing for more. From Kevan Edwards you get a genuine human who is trying to help you learn. what more can you ask for.,It would not let me select 401 so I chose 533. This professor was amazing and super nice and helpful. He was always available outside class for help. His main focus was just on helping students understand material rather. He always asked for feedback and wondered how he could be better.,"Take him for Philosophy. If your interested in this stuff you'll prob learn a lot. But its also a easy course if you don't care. Only a few papers for homework. He gives you all the questions that will be on the exam, all you need to do is answer them beforehand and memorize them. All notes are on Blackboard."
C. Noble,3.8,"Solid professor, however extremely dry at times. The class and movies are interesting enough to hold their own and definitely worth taking, however Noble as its instructor doesn't do much to make the material engaging. Can also be difficult to reach outside of class.",Knowledgeable and competent but about as dry as chalk. Lectures drag and he is pretty difficult to communicate with outside of class.,absolutely the worst class that I have taken.
J. Dowell,1.9,"Readings are gone over in depth in class, so it's not necessary to read everything. Papers are graded by TAs. Follow and answer prompts, lecture slides are . Lectures not tracked but really helpful for writing papers and understanding complex philosophical ideas, participation counts towards small part of grade. Slides are randomly posted/ updated","Readings are pretty unnecessary if you pay attention to lectures or just understand her posted lecture notes. She doesnt grade anything- only TAs, so make sure you know how they grade and follow prompts exactly. All essay based, no tests. Simple course just fairly uninteresting.","I don't think that this professor is as bad as other reviewers think. She was really passionate about the class topics which made the lectures enjoyable. There were a LOT of long readings but honestly, she goes through them all in class so you don't necessarily need to read them if you are understanding class. TA's does all of the grading."
N. Fonger,2.8,"Nicole's goal was to teach future teachers how to make accessible for all students. In the end, she taught us that we DO have the power throwing in drawn out explanations, assignments that don't replicate the teachings in class, diversity insensitive practice to those in the room that aren't white females. Culturally unaware of how she presented it",She goes way to fast throughout the lectures. She teaches the difficult way to her students but never teaches an easier way to understand the problem.,"Prof Fonger makes calc manageable and is a great prof. She is always available for extra help and cares about her students. Calc itself is not easy, but she tries to make it fun. Her notes are super organized, and she is excellent at explaining concepts. I also got a fantastic ta!! If you can take a class w/ her, do it - you won't regret it!"
S. Caviness,4.3,"She listens to your questions. she does everything she can to ensure that you understand what is being taught and takes the time to help you if you don't. Her assignments are tough but she will help and answer any questions she deems appropriate. If you pay attention, ask questions, do the work and actually try it'll be an easy A.",Professor Seale taught me a great deal over the course of my class. I believe I will be a better paralegal in the future thanks to her!,
B. Odiwuor,2.8,Brief introduction.,Useless knowledge. Inexplicable homework. Only TA helpful,1-Knowledgeable professor 2-Everyweek quiz and homework and those cause you to be prepared for exams 3-Helpful professor 4-Provide opportunities for extra scores with extra assignments 5-Good experience 6-I suggest you to get the course
J. Masingila,3.5,"If you need to take MAT 117, 100% take it with her. This class is confusing and a little challenging, however if you make an effort to constantly go to her office hours, it will make a huge difference. She really cared about her students and wanted us to do well. I wish I could take another one of her classes.",Prof Masingila did very well with making the course content comprehendable and was always willing to help when needed. She really does care about her students.,"I loved Professor Masinglia. I usually hate math, and struggle with it, but she made it enjoyable and easy. If you read the chapters and paid attention in class, it will be a breeze. I joined late, but due to her teaching style was able to understand the material I missed well enough. She always has office hours as well! I really enjoyed MAT 117."
R. Ayine,3.5,Prof Kabi is super fun and tries his best to make online classes entertaining and interactive. Would definitely take his class again!,"Easy class - he's a funny, quirky guy. You can do the minimum and do fine, or do extra and get a good grade. He's disorganized + relies on class discussion basically the entire time - almost no lecturing. He's flexible and a little out there but the case studies are interesting. A good way to bolster the GPA if you're willing to do a little extra",Professor Kabi was amazing - absolutely recommend his courses to anyone who has the opportunity. I've been using his teachings in my real job for over 3 years now. By far one of my most memorable professors at NYU.
M. Oluoch,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,

X. Au,1.7,"Professor Au can be tough, but if you put in the work, the class is manageable. I found Unstuck ai and the free textbook really helpful for study prep. Attend office hours and you'll do well.","Suanne is not a BAD professor, but it is extremely difficult to do well in her class due to her grading. It's a bit unfair that your grade is determined more by having her over other professors than by your understanding of the material.","Worst Professor ever. This is my first time rating a professor and it's because of her. Show up to the class every time even go to her office hour for 3-4 times. EXTREMELY NOT HELPFUL AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!! I still fail the quizzes, the lecture means nothing, can't understand a thing. If you like torture yourself go and take this class. GOOD LUCK."
X. Duan,3.7,"Mr. Marcy is a professor who clearly grew up with the technology that he's teaching. We learned the history, physics, and logic of semi-conductor devices, using FPGA boards and VHDL hardware design language for lab. For the last project, we implemented a primitive CPU based on Intel's original CPU (4004). Friday lab sucks, but he made it fun!","He's very knowledgeable of what he teaches and is more than willing to help you understand or troubleshoot a problem you're having. Having a strong coding background is really nice to have for this class. The class is very hands-on, it's crucial you try to understand what you're trying to accomplish. Overall, one of the best professors at SU.","Amazing professor. Really loves his field and is such a modernized professor. Very accessible outside of class, patient, and knowledgeable. If you are an engineer, definitely take his classes. It can be challenging but with the right group and dedicated hours after class, it is not impossible to pass. A blessing to Syracuse University!"
T. Kisakye,5.0,Professor Kisakye is a motivational and passionate Professor. He solves all assigned questions for weekly handouts. He motivated me to not drop the class and follow through.,,
J. Yu,1.7,"Avoid this professor at all costs, if I could I would give him a zero. After the first exam, my friend and I just stopped showing up and learned the class on our own... our grades went up. The strategy is to memorize the steps the practice exams, which are almost word for word copies of the real exams. This professor is truly ""Yuan in a Million"".",I'd rather watch paint dry than listen to a Yuan Yuan lecture. He is EXTREMELY boring. I didin't got to class the last 2 months of the semester because I was better off teaching myself. If YUAN'T a daily migrain you should attend his class in the morning.,Professor Yuan often reads directly from the slides and takes a while to explain concepts clearly. Decent amount of homework. Two fairly easy and straightforward midterm exams and weekly quizzes that were also simple. Go to class and office hours!
E. Downing,3.7,"Not exactly a course to remember. I switched to another school and was able to see a tremendous difference. This course should be renamed and presented as ""Ear training for singers"". Not recommended for musicians and instrumentalists. While I got a good grade compared to others, I did not particularly like the teaching methods or the material.",There is no technique taught in class. You're expected to do things on his level and his way only which is stupid considering that a subject like ear training is completely subjective and different for everyone. He shows favoritism and spends most of the class telling stories. He needs to be evaluated because this class is least productive.,"Ear Training should be a fun class. This class felt like chewing glass. It accounts only for one credit, and you will need to work ten times more just to barely make it. Professor Downing is very arbitrary and puts people on the spot. Most students find the experience humiliating and either withdraw, change majors or transfer to another school."
R. Margrey,4.2,So easy to get an A. Open note exams and opportunities for extra credit on all homework. Didn't do the last unit of homework and still got over 100 in this class. He's so sweet and always willing to help.,"lectures are not mandatory. if you complete the homework by a certain date you will get extra credit. easiest class at SU, def would take again",Genuinely hard to not get an A. Every test is exactly what's on the study guide and he gives answers to each study guide. Also you get formulas on each test. Weekly online homework that if you do early is extra credit added onto your grade each unit. One of the easiest math classes I've ever taken. Love this man
"J. Appiah
J. Appiah",3.4,"Honestly was surprised to see how he has some bad ratings- he's a funny guy who cares about his student. Very accessible especially around exams, and I appreciate doing accounting in excel which is real. Would gladly take another one of his classes- straight forward exams that don't shock you.","literally the worst prof ever. assigns a 24 hour project in the middle of finals that is just busy excel work. learned absolutely nothing in this class, just how to use excel. exams are literally impossible and nothing is helpful because theres no actual learning","Really nice person and the class is very easy, but you will learn nothing. He assigns a pointless final project that costs $50 to sign up for with very convoluted instructions, and didn't respond to emails asking to clarify."
T. John,2.5,this dude hates his life and makes it his students problem,Hate this guy so much with passion.,Absolutely awful. His lectures are unorganized and honestly just disrespectful for his students. He uses a spiral notebook and writes about 5-10 words a page before he flips to the next. Thats how you learn. He doesnt give you any practice problems instead he just makes them up as he goes. When it comes time for exams there is no study guide.
E. Shevchenko,3.0,One of the worst courses & professors I've had at TWU. Beyond frustrating that this course is ONLY taught by her & is required for the degree plan. I take her class online & the way she has Canvas structured is very messy and confusing. Beware if you take this course online you HAVE to show your work by scanning in your test problems.,"Please do not take this professor! She is honestly the worst professor I have taken. Her lectures are extremely confusing. She jumps from problems and pulls examples out of her head. She also ""teaches"" extremely fast and does not slow down. The majority of students in our class are failing and she does not care. Save your GPA and DO NOT take her!!",Worst professor here. It is extremely unfortunate that she's the only one teaching this REQUIRED course. You'll need to purchase the book which she CONSISTENTLY says NOT to refer to because you basically need to do the math her way. Huge waste of money.. you're looking to pay 150 just to access the hw. At least hw is due at the end of the course?
A. Sun,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
C. Yin,3.7,"*SOC303 is what i took it just didnt have an option for it I liked professor Ma, she knows what shes talking about and is very interesting. If you go to class, pay attention, and are engaged you'll do great and you'll learn a lot that you didn't know before. My only complaint is she often kept us past time of class. but liked her class!",She's definitely making no contributions to the class. She makes two students do their own presentations every class and she spends the last fifteen or twenty minutes to read her ppts of reading summaries and play the video. She stumbles a lot. She said she's a tough grader but she's not tough on herself.,She's very passionate about her course and class. Would recommend her especially if you're Asian-American. She inspired me.

Y. Zhang,3.5,"For PSC 300 AI Ethics. You're mainly graded on your midterm and final, along with two small in-class presentations that are easy to do. She allows AI to be used in class. Attendance is done via. Google Form, which are posted at the beginning on class, so you don't need to physically go if you don't feel like it.","Okay class. She means well but you are not graded on much. 2 tests, 1 paper and recitation participation.",She is so passionate and kind! She gives lots of extra help and the exams are so fair and easy. The only homework is reading
M. Alan,3.7,"Professor Allport is Top A, a highly esteemed educator and was the highlight of my time at Syracuse University. His exceptional teaching made history not only engaging but also enjoyable. Reading is a fundamental part of college, and he excels at bringing the subject to life. An A+ professor who truly enhances the learning experience!”","Professor Allport was a great professor who genuinely cared about his students. His lectures were great and informative. Prof Allport assigned a lot of readings but it was manageable. You get graded off 6 quizzes, 6 response papers and he drops the lowest one. He also required a student led discussion for a class. I would definitely recommend him!",Quite literally the rudest most condescending professor I have ever had. Do not recommend.
L. Wickham,3.0,"Mr. Gaddy is a pretty good professor. He takes a while to grade your work but overall he grades fairly and gives great feedback for essays, etc. Hes a nice and understanding professor as well.","I took Mr. Gaddy in what was obviously his first semester teaching. He was not particularly bad or good. The basic structure of the course was to do a reading each night, then come back to class the next day and discuss it. Occasionally there would be a pop quiz but all other grades come from the three essays that you have to write in class.",
J. Liao,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"
T. Scheuing,3.1,Worst professor I have ever taken and this is not dramatic. Participation counts as 30% of your overall grade. Goes around the class one by one as you answer questions from the exercises in the book every class but somehow some people will receive 12/12 and some will get failing participation grades. If you want a fair teacher do not take him.,"He's not a bad professor overall, but he made the class a bit confusing. He wouldn't answer questions clearly and he went over the material a bit too quick sometimes. There is a midterm and a final and you usually work in groups during class.","Great Professor. Overall easy class. He makes it very easy to understand. Weekly online quizzes, if you read the chapter you will have an easy A. No homework, just a midterm and final both open book."
M. Kramer,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
T. Sentagne,3.1,Worst professor I have ever taken and this is not dramatic. Participation counts as 30% of your overall grade. Goes around the class one by one as you answer questions from the exercises in the book every class but somehow some people will receive 12/12 and some will get failing participation grades. If you want a fair teacher do not take him.,"He's not a bad professor overall, but he made the class a bit confusing. He wouldn't answer questions clearly and he went over the material a bit too quick sometimes. There is a midterm and a final and you usually work in groups during class.","Great Professor. Overall easy class. He makes it very easy to understand. Weekly online quizzes, if you read the chapter you will have an easy A. No homework, just a midterm and final both open book."
F. Jarrin Acosta,4.5,"She was an amazing Spanish teacher. I took her for SPN1&2 and I'd do it again. I had no prior SPN experience but I learned a lot in her class. It's not an easy A, but if you put in the effort, you can learn Spanish&get the grade bc she really is there to help. She's clear about all of the assignments, as much as she's allowed to be. TAKE HER CLASS!",Shes very nice but goes through the material very fast.,

A. Bourhim,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
M. Perry,1.9,"By far the worst professor I've had at Syracuse. If you have the option, take this class with someone else. Lectures were useless, office hours didn't help, and the only way to pass was to read the book and teach yourself everything. The exams were fair but way too hard considering how unprepared we all were.","The worst econ professor I've ever had at Syracuse. You will not learn anything and you will have to teach yourself for exams. There's no point in going to lectures. TA's can't even help and office hours are useless. If you can take another professor for this class, do yourself a favor and do it. If not, get a tutor or find a genius. Good luck!",He is so quite when teaching and he just thinks that we know everything
B. Parthasarathy,2.8,Brief introduction.,Useless knowledge. Inexplicable homework. Only TA helpful,1-Knowledgeable professor 2-Everyweek quiz and homework and those cause you to be prepared for exams 3-Helpful professor 4-Provide opportunities for extra scores with extra assignments 5-Good experience 6-I suggest you to get the course
S. Traver,4.3,"She listens to your questions. she does everything she can to ensure that you understand what is being taught and takes the time to help you if you don't. Her assignments are tough but she will help and answer any questions she deems appropriate. If you pay attention, ask questions, do the work and actually try it'll be an easy A.",Professor Seale taught me a great deal over the course of my class. I believe I will be a better paralegal in the future thanks to her!,
R. Maharjan,1.9,She is a kind person but she may be one of the most difficult to understand professors I have ever had. She often cannot solve her own problems correctly on the first try and has been corrected by students more often than not. Her lectures are impossible to comprehend because all she does is put examples on the board and expects us to solve them.,She is the most boring professor ever. The class feels like it is 4 hours long and she consistently gets questions wrong and students need to help her out. She is by far the worst teacher I have. Highly recommend taking anyone else,Do not take her!! She is the most boring prof i have ever had. She makes mistakes often and students can not trust her answers as they are often wrong. Take anyone else
E. Israel,5.0,Elana is a great teacher. She makes all the topics really clear and easy to understand. She is firm but very fair and gives you lots of opportunities to get yourself a good grade. She provides lots of worsheets and practice along with her lectures so you can get lots of practice.,Elana is an amazing professor and her lectures are very interactive. She is there to help if you have any questions and she is super caring. I would highly recommend taking any class taught by her.,
K. Schmitz,4.2,"Professor Schmitz is the man. He is so stereotypically German and it is wonderful. He is hilarious, his lectures are engaging, amazingly smart, always gives you multiple viewpoints surrounding issues. If you participate in class and care he will like you a lot and remember your name. Very vibrant personality and easy to connect with.","Very nice but loses it when people are on cell phones; articles aren't necessary but helpful, holds review sessions for mid term and final, huge final paper turned in at intervals, go to office hours with him or the TA's, very knowledgable and experienced in human rights but prefers collaborative learning, so lots of group work","Professor Schmitz is awful. I literally learned nothing, as he spent the semester rambling. In October he asked us what he should teach for the rest of the semester. The average grade in the class is currently a 72. Still, one midterm and a few papers. You also don't need any of the readings to do well."
S. Diaz,3.2,HORRIBLE TEACHER. The fact that he has a PHD in mathetmatics baffles me. He cannot teach and his voice is monotone. HE'S absolutely not enthusiastic. The only way to stay AFLOAT is to study on your own. The course and the teacher cannot display information great. Use youtube and other resources. I hope he sees the bad impact that he has on students,"This Professor absolute horrible. I'm taking MAT285, he's absolutely MONOTONE. Has no exam practice. No guidlines or extra help placed on blackboard. The only way to pass is to study on your own and survive. He wears a mask, even though its 2025!!!. That says a lot. As a professor you're supposed to engage and help students, however he doesn't!!!!!","Professor Diaz knows what he is doing but is the most confusing professor I have ever met. He is extremely unorganized, his notes are all over the place since he writes down every word on the board and doesn't use powerpoints. I have never met a more monotone man. It is extremely tough to learn from him, I teach myself, but the exams are simple."
M. Vance,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
J. Beckmann,1.0,"So first off test are 80% of our grade. He had multiple exams were there was curves of +25 point. He rushes, he doesn't explain well, when asking for help he lowkey just ignores it. He is just really not good, and everyone in the class is struggling. At some point it's not a indiual student problem and a professor problem. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",,
J. Wei,2.7,"I really like her. She is so chill and down to earth. Also the WRT 205 class with her was so easy you just need to do the homework basically and its so easy and she is always there to answer your questions. We dont have papers, and theres alot of peer review but no group projects.","I took her for WRT 307 Service Learning, the class was okay. The grade is determined by 3 projects which aren't hard but can be tedious. The last project is the Agency Project, which requires you to collaborate with an organization which can be time-consuming to find. The Professor was very respectful to students and gave good feedback.",WRT307 sucks no matter what but professor weiner makes the class 1000x more painful than any other professor. Classes are spent doing required activities that are meaningless and none of the homework or projects have anything to do with writing. And if she tells you you're in a service learning class RUN
D. Graysay,4.9,"AMAZING Prof. who really cares about his students and their learning of mathematics. Explained simple topics that I had never fully understood and complex topics that arose in calc 2. Lecture style is mostly working on practice problems and learning as you go, and I had a better understanding of the topics than I did for calc 1. Math Dept. legend!!","Dr. Graysay is an amazing professor! He genuinely wants all his students to do well and is incredibly accommodating and flexible, as well as caring. I learned so much from his class and actually enjoyed going to class. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you have the opportunity!","Dr.Graysay was an awesome professor. His lecture was at 8 am so sometimes it was harder to pay attention, but Graysay made sure to keep us awake by putting us in groups. Overall I learned a lot and had a good time :)"
"S. Wehrli
C. Monahan",4.6,"Prof Wehrli has really long and fast lectures. You have to pay 100% attention in order to record all of the notes. That said, his homework is easy if you pay attention. He tells you exactly what will be on the exams, and it isn't close to all of the lecture material. He is clear and fair.","He is a very sweet, caring, and helpful professor! He's very shy in the meantime, but he is still always willing to help his students and thus always available for them. He is very responsive to his emails too. He always made sure I understood the materials and their concepts well, giving more than enough number of examples!",Wehrli is one of the best math professors I've ever had. He's very shy but the cute kind of shy. Gems really easy to talk to and extremely helpful in his office hours. Easy grader and he genuinely cares that you learn his material. Great guy
"X. Au
A. Krause",3.0,"She does not answer any questions asked and if she does, she responds in a rude way that doesn't answer the question either. The lectures are extremely confusing. She does not cover all the information on the quizzes that are assigned every lecture and have a time limit of 5 minutes for multiple questions involving calculations. Worst prof ever.","The homework is fine, no extra credit, could waive 4 or 5 quiz score, but the exam was so hard. Since 2020 was all online class, just in case people cheating on exam, she made exams much harder. I used to have ap calculus, but this for me, I couldnt take it anymore. The final grade is not great at all.","While attendance is not mandatory, don't skip or else you won't even know what you don't even know. Seek help from TA, and Tutors for this class!!! Practice a lot of problems before the exam. Online definitely made it harder as she made the entire exam in M/C. One wrong and you lose all the points. Without TA, I probably be lost in this class."
"K. He
K. He",2.5,"He's a good prof just can be confusing at times. He knows math very well and will answer any questions you have but he just thinks about the math in a very face pace way so he may not catch what you are confused about at first. Overall, he is a good prof just ask if you are confused, and he will happily explain. Also emails back very fast",Made this class much harder than it needed to be. Does not go into detail on the content. He mutters under his breath and you can barely understand him while he just writes on the board with no explanation at all. I've had more success watching youtube videos that actually explain the concepts. Doesn't respond to emails either.,I took him last semester. His teaching is bad. He makes a lot of mistakes in his lectures and the students have to point it out. His teaching is confusing and you have to learn by yourself on your own time. He goes way too fast and is ahead of other professors even though he's just a grad student. Because of the fast pace it's also hard to learn.
"K. Shaw
C. Sato",4.7,"Shaw is the best. Funny, caring, and kind. The class is very manageable as long as you go to lecture and stay organized. 2 HW assignments a week and you get 33% extra credit if you do them early. 2 tests and a final that basically are duplicates of the study guides - do those and you'll ace the exams. Recitations had weekly quizzes but were fine.",Best math teacher I've ever had. Goes into extreme detail for everything. HW for every lecture but do it early and you get crazy extra credit. Two easy midterms; just know how to work the study guides. Weekly recitation was useless (mandatory attendance) and TA's were mid. Recitation quizzes were ok. Stay on top of the work and you'll get an A.,"Professor Shaw is amazing. I was scared to take a math class because I have always been bad at math, but I did very well. Don't skip the lectures because you will fall behind and be confused. Review sheets are always the same as the tests. Do the homework early!! Go to office hours or talk to the TA if you are confused."
"K. Shaw
K. Pollicove",4.7,"Hands down, the BES professor SU has ever employed! I learned so much from Prof. ""Buzz"" Shaw. His course changed my life. I wish he did not retire. The other professors could learn a thing or two about how to conduct an online course from him!","Great teacher, hands down...he was SU's Chancellor from 91' - 04', so his leadership insights are very interesting",SUPER EASY - Material is fun to read but the class is boring.
"J. Ryan
K. Pollicove",4.5,"one of the BEST ECN prof in SU, nice person with huge knowledge base. Dont expect the course will be easy, its a 400-level class. Mainly study in model and graph, do not require a lot of math. Study hard, the n you get A.","Super nice, passionate and knows what he's teaching. Tests are kinda hard so need to study but material isn't impossible. Grade determined by 5 HW's based on effort/completion, 3 easy writing assignments based on a podcast and 3 tests. Grading scale helps a lot (85 = A, 70 = B). It's what you'd expect of an upper level class and I would recommend.",
J. Meyer,4.5,Professor is very clumsily and all over the place. He does not put grades in until end of semester and you won't know your grade until after final exams 💀. Take Pawel he's much better.,"He's good at math but not teaching. His presentations are poor, he rambles off-topic, and his teaching feels disorganized. He's about to retire so he's lazy with his job in general. Take math classes with Professor Pawel Grzegrzolka instead—he's the best, cares about students, teaches excellently, and has top-notch course materials. good luck! lol","Do not expect to learn anything math-related thing, you'll just learn methods of solving problems at the exam. Pretty Straightforward and easy exams. However, he doesn't care about his students at all, he will mostly refer you to TAs. Never tries to meet students, skips his office hours, and doesn't give extra credit assignments or HW extensions."
K. Pollicove,4.3,"Collins is an absolutely incredible professor. I had him for two semesters in a row, and I am incredibly sad that I cannot take any more classes with him. Collins deeply cares about his material, and he wants you to care about it as well. He is a tough grader, but he always provides good feedback to improve for the next paper.","I'm a 4.0 high school student. Lost all interest in school. After 5 semesters of going through the motions, Collins gave me a reason to be excited for school. Nothing he teaches is easy to understand, nor is it compelling material. However, his knowledge and willingness to be personable is a strength. He will leave you WANTING to read more.",He best professor
J. Komissar,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"
P. Klingert,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her. She is a great teacher, but confusing. You should go over her power point and do homework problems and you will receive an A."

Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
U. Banerjee,2.8,"At least among professors who taught MAT 331, professor Uday Banerjee is definitely the one someone could take class with. He provides ppts with all you should know on BB. The homework is designed not specifically hard if someone really have read the materials.","Dr. Banerjee is such a great professor! He goes over material very slowly and in detail, making sure that everyone understands. He encourages questions and is so helpful if you go to his office hours. He can sometimes go over things a little too slowly or too many times, but this can also be helpful when you're struggling with a topic.","Do not take his class! If you are struggling and attend his office hours he's not willing to help you and doesn't explain more except to review the lecture slides. Homework is 50% of your grade so complete all of them, or you will get below a B. Exams are not extremely difficult if you study."
L. Shen,3.4,"Professor Shen is an okay professor. He covers the material but often does so in an abstract way that makes it difficult to follow and reproduce (which makes it especially difficult in a coding class). His teaching methods become easier to follow as the semester goes on. If you have to take a class with him you'll be fine, but it may be difficult.","While Professor Lixin does his best to teach...he often falls short. His explanations are extremely abstract and don't make sense. He doesn't do much teaching but rather ""I'll just show you"". It's a real shame because he is genuinely a very nice person and it is clear that he wants you to succeed, but if you want to learn...I would avoid him.","Knowledgable and patient professor, you can make a appointment with him in office hour outside the class, he is willing to explain problems to you. He is kind in grading, you can ask him about the homework questions, he will tell you a hint to do it."
H. Rahmati,3.5,At times seemed unprepared for lecture. Weekly quizzes that are graded harshly. One computation mistake can land you at least 4 points off out of 20. Makes Linear Algebra harder to understand than it needs to be.,This professor cares more about people checking their phone than actually speaking clearly and talking us through examples. His lectures are near impossible to get a grasp of and just consist of rushing to get down all his notes. Don't bother sending emails because they seem to be ignored and rely heavily on your TA to help you get through.,"I had a medical emergency and left before finals. He was hardly accommodating and gave me a week to take the final exam with a proctor at a local university, even though he was aware I was hospitalized and was unable to do so because of this. He didn't give me an incomplete so I got an F even though the circumstances were entirely out of my control"
"G. Verchota
E. Cochran",2.0,Dr. Verchota is a nice guy but his teaching methods could be improved. He doesn't give nearly enough examples in class to really help the students understand the concepts. The quizzes were always worded differently than the homework and it was generally hard to prepare for the pop quizzes and exams. He's a nice guy but difficult teaching style.,Worst math professor I've had in college. All he does is write proofs and theories in class and if you ask him to go over an example he will try and probably get himself confused. I can confidently say I didn't learn a single thing from his lectures and had to teach myself everything.,He is a very boring professor and writes down theories for the first hour of class. He will only show examples at the end and ask you to look at examples on your own. I had to teach myself the content and just read his notes. He tries to give as many points on exams and quizzes.
"E. Cochran
I. Pitici",4.6,"Professor Pitici is one of the worst math professors at SU. His lectures consist of writing a bunch of stuff on the board as small as possible while he repeats ""you should know this from high school"". His class is poorly planned out and the tests are a complete mystery as he doesn't provide any information about what is on them.","Brilliant man, teaches fast, not receptive to class questions. Lectures are essential but not enough to succeed. HW/quizzes don't reflect exams. Hardest exams of all the sections. Doesn't want students to fail. Returns points, once gave test corrections when whole class failed. 2 exams,1 final. HW and quizzes don't matter if you do well on exams.","Pitici's MAT485 is challenging but rewarding. Attend lectures, ask questions, and use tools like Unstuck ai to prep - you'll leave with a strong grasp of the material."
"E. Javor
S. Du",3.4,"Easiest class I've ever taken. Such a good professor. Provides all slides and online lecture videos. Only graded on 4 exams and 2 short assignments. Exams are very simple if you watch the lectures. Class requires minimal effort, highly recommend.",I took his online class over the summer and it wasn't that hard. 4 homework assignments 50% of your grade and 2 exams 50% of your grade. You're able to use your notes and all course materials for your exam. Watch every single lecture thoroughly (1hr & 40min) and take notes. It might be draining but you can easily get an A like this it's worth it,Prof. Dutkowski clearly loves what he teaches. He tries to make lectures fun and tries to help you understand. 4 tests and 1 from the first 3 tests gets lowest grade dropped. He doesn't take attendance but if you don't go to class you will be confused. Take lots of notes the tests are open notes! Overall the class is awesome and so is Dutkowski.
"S. Du
E. Javor",4.1,"Professor Du has great lectures and good labs. You learn a lot from labs and lectures and for the whole semester. That is until you get to the final exam where it's 50% of the grade. If you don't do well in exams, you're done for. Exams are very long and heavy and stressful, it sucks that they weigh that much of the grade","The most work intensive and stressful class I have ever taken, labs are considered homework and will take up a lot of your time. Be sure to study for quizzes and exams! Readying the textbook will 100% help you on all exams/quizzes. Do the practice questions on his website, and you will pass. Professor comes off cold, but super helpful if you try.","There is no homework in this class, but there is lab and labs are considered 'homework' Labs aren't hard, but time consuming.

Y. Zhao,2.8,"Professor Zhao is a great professor. As long as you show up and put a little effort into the course, you will do fine. All the other comments are just people being lazy and not putting any work at all. The course is a fairly difficult because its Finance after all. She also does homework problems in class with you!","Prof. Zhao's lectures are extremely fast paced, and as the class goes on, she describes things less and less clearly. The homework isn't horrible, but there's a lot of it. I learned a lot about excel through this course, and she is nice, but it was overall so confusing and she is now using a lockdown browser for exams, so watch out for that.",this class is very fast paced. It can be very difficult to keep up with the material and fully comprehend it. She does not do a good job in explaining most of the material.

After the first exam, my friend and I just stopped showing up and learned the class on our own... our grades went up. The strategy is to memorize the steps the practice exams, which are almost word for word copies of the real exams. This professor is truly ""Yuan in a Million"".",I'd rather watch paint dry than listen to a Yuan Yuan lecture. He is EXTREMELY boring. I didin't got to class the last 2 months of the semester because I was better off teaching myself. If YUAN'T a daily migrain you should attend his class in the morning.,Professor Yuan often reads directly from the slides and takes a while to explain concepts clearly. Decent amount of homework. Two fairly easy and straightforward midterm exams and weekly quizzes that were also simple. Go to class and office hours!

S. Wehrli,4.6,"Prof Wehrli has really long and fast lectures. You have to pay 100% attention in order to record all of the notes. That said, his homework is easy if you pay attention. He tells you exactly what will be on the exams, and it isn't close to all of the lecture material. He is clear and fair.","He is a very sweet, caring, and helpful professor! He's very shy in the meantime, but he is still always willing to help his students and thus always available for them. He is very responsive to his emails too. He always made sure I understood the materials and their concepts well, giving more than enough number of examples!",Wehrli is one of the best math professors I've ever had. He's very shy but the cute kind of shy. Gems really easy to talk to and extremely helpful in his office hours. Easy grader and he genuinely cares that you learn his material. Great guy
L. Kovalev,4.1,This was such an easy class. You can get 70's and 80's on a few of the exams and still end the class with an A. He had so so much extra credit on tests and homework. This was easy and not hard.,"Professor Kovalev was amazing, he gives a really good opportunity for extra credit on HW and the exams are easy as long as you complete the HW and use study guides. He posts all his lecture notes and even has class recordings.",I literally never go to class and still have an A. He posts all the lecture notes on blackboard so you can just teach urself everything. Can get CRAZY extra credit if you submit the problem sets more than a day before they're due. Holds office hours on zoom everyday- all around good dude. Tests aren't bad either.
J. Liu,2.8,"Professor was fine. Personally found class really difficult but that wasn't his fault. 3 exams all online which saved me i would have failed. He's interesting just thought the content was super boring. If you have to take this class, i would choose this professor over another","Professor Liu is a great professor. He really tries to make sure the student truly understands the material and how it applies to real life. He is very willing to help, you just need to go to him first during office hours. He gives lots of extra credit and gives partial credit on problem sets on tests.",Very kind professor. Genuinely wants the best for his students but the course content is just a little difficult.
J. Onninen,4.3,Prof Jani is extremely hard to understand and speaks in broken english and broken sentences. His lectures are hard to follow due to him skipping steps on how to do a math problem. I had to learn most of the material on my own through other resources. Weekly quizzes in recitation and 4 exams total. He did post good practice problems before exams.,"You need to attend lectures to actually learn the material as he posts no notes, and even so his lectures are sometimes confusing. Overall, he is a good and funny professor but I had to put in a lot of time studying to do well. There are weekly quizzes and multiple tests, but he provides practice problems that are very helpful with studying.","He is a really great professor. His accent is only a small barrier and he is quite the comedian. Despite the have content of Calc II, he makes it interesting with dumb comments and jokes. He is a great teacher and is always available if you need extra help."
L. Kennard,1.0,"He is definitely the meanest professor I've ever had in college, bar none. If you have any other choice, do not take his class. Trust me, he makes some very simple things very complicated and assigns difficult assignments in every class. He says he wants us to spend 5 or 6 hours a week outside of class in this course. It's really hilarious.","Absolutely ridiculous time scale for quizzes and exams. Exams were always insanely lengthy and difficult. Studying all day, every day did not make a difference.",Quizzes about every other class. Four exams and a disgustingly hard final. The final was 5 questions but each question had 5 other questions that each were brutally hard and took 10 to 30 minutes each. There is absolutely no possible way to completely either his quizzes or exams in time. The lack of time is reflected in your grade.
P. Chen,3.0,Most boring Lecture I've taken at Syracuse and the slides don't have much information on them. Good lucking making sense of the material in this course.,"Very nice and easy grader, clearly wants everyone to do well",
J. Pollitz,5.0,Dr. Josh is amazing! I learned amazing amounts from him! He has very high expectations but pushes you in the right way to maximize your potential! Definitely take!,"Pollitz is a great professor! Makes the material way more understandable. He has high expectations for students, sometimes too high, but balances that with very helpful lectures. I think he cares a lot about students learning and pushes you to really learn it. Show up to class and work hard! I got a lot out of the course from time in class!",
W. Wylie,4.6,Hes a really nice prof.,This guy is the only math prof at SU that can teach. He is also the only one that actually cares.,hes the best
S. Maroo,3.1,"Professor Maroo took me by surprise. I expected energy conversion to be a difficult, yet interesting class, and Professor Maroo nailed it, he made the content easy to digest by writing the class notes with us, making the notes easy to copy down. The exams and weekly quizzes were difficult, but I would still recommend him.",He had no idea how the solution of a partial differential equation is found. If you question him he will get mad at you. If you go to him during office hours he will send you back to read the textbook.,"Lectures are excellent, clearly conveys topics and writes easy to understand lecture notes. Office hours are helpful and hes generally a kind person and fairly understanding. Highly recommend."
M. Erdman,3.2,if you have to take this class then 1 thing I would suggest is study and learn the materials on your own because otherwise the lectures are a waste of time and they mostly consist of him going on tangents about unnecessary things.,"I like Erdman's classes, but his lecture slides can be a bit overwhelming. He really cares about his students but this often leads to rambling and having to play catch-up with content. The textbook is helpful but isn't necessary for passing the class. There is a good balance between homework, studying, and free time necessary for doing well.","Class is composed of H.W every other week, 4 exams, and participation. Erdman's test questions are way better than Silver's. He rambles and is behind during lectures & doesn't teach the material well, but an understanding person. You should self-learn the course once you are exposed to the material to do well. Utilize CLASS tutoring!"
J. Anderson,2.7,Lecture was hard to follow because he rambled on and on and didn't provide a powerpoint or anything. There are readings assigned for HW every class and if you don't read them you'll be lost in both lecture and recitation (recitation cold calls). Since I attended more than (i think) 90% or 85% of recitation I didn't have to take the final.,"Lecture was pointless, TA was insufferable but genuinely cared ab teaching and carried the course. No powerpoint/visual component to lecture made it difficult to take notes, grading criteria is absolutely insane and the exams were difficult because they were open response.",I feel like this class had zero structure and the TA did all the teaching. Going to lecture was completely useless and he never used a single visual in his teaching (a simple PowerPoint would've sufficed). Overall did not enjoy my time in this class and there are better humanities profs out there
Z. Gan,5.0,"I learned a lot from his lectures. He assigned a lot of homework and problem sets, which were very helpful. The Zoom recordings he provided were useful throughout the entire course. His explanations were very clear. He is a tough grader, but I would love to take his classes again.","Although I received an average grade, I learned a lot from his lectures. His explanations were very clear, and he gave many assignments and practice problems, which helped a lot. However, he is a tough grader. I would love to take his course again.","His class is hard, however, his lectures are very detailed and he explains each concept thoroughly. If you show up to his lectures, you will 100% pass. He is very nice and funny as well. There is no homework grade, however, you will be graded on quizzes that are weekly and 4 exams. He prints out notes as well, which makes it easier to follow along."
D. Carnegie,5.0,"I don't know if he is still teaching, I took him in 2013 and he was a GREAT professor, he teaches you life lessons that you won't forget, he is amazing and makes you exit that class after every lecture thinking that you are a great person and you can do great things in life, hope he is still teaching. ALL respect to this professor","Am one of those that are very shy when it comes to public speaking,D Mann gave me the courage and confident to stand and speak in public. He makes you understand that no one is perfect; that we are all here to learn. Take him, you will be glad you did!!!",

"J. Anderson
J. Anderson",2.0,"Professor Anderson is an alright professor. I think a lot of the reviews on this page are a little critical. While her ""lectures"" were just us watching recordings of her staring into our souls through a camera, she did provide very useful examples in class and was willing to answer questions asked in class. She was not accessible outside of class.","She wont answer any emails regarding homework assignments that arent posted, and will not teach you a singular thing in class. If you ask any questions she goes about the longest way possible to not answer that question. Than forces you to buy a $150 textbook you use 3-5 times total.","Classes are a waist of time as all the information you need to learn comes from videos and the textbook which she makes you read and watch before class. Lots of homework, labs and projects which are all strictly graded. There is a lack of effort outside the classroom as emails are rarely answered and TAs are never available."

J. Ahn,3.8,I am shocked to see good reviews of this professor. His notes are sharpie on sheets of printer paper that have no organization. I could take perfect notes but look back on them and have 0 clue what I was even looking at because it was just random problems with no description. It was extremely hard to follow along with him. Just so bad overall.,MAE 486 was the hardest class I have taken by far but Professor Ahn made it bearable. His examples in class are extremely helpful and very valuable when doing the HW. This was the second course I have taken with Dr. Ahn and I would take a third one in a heartbeat. Highly recommend this professor.,"I'm not a fan of people rating a professor poorly just because they teach a hard class. Thermodynamics was hard, but doable and Ahn made it understandable with a lot of examples."

Grading not harsh, but learning content from his slides will drive you crazy.","You are given 3 papers and 6 homework assignments and that's it! His grading on the homework is vague and unhelpful, you are simply give your score with minimal (if any) feedback. The grading on the paper's honestly seems to have no meaning behind it, he just slaps a grade on the paper. The lectures are EXTREMELY dry. I do not recommend.","Graded on homework assignments, 3 projects, and attendance. The homework assignments are pretty easy, but you don't get feedback, just the grade. The projects are vague.

The final project is in-depth but I did it the weekend before it was due (not recommended).,"I didn't think he was very hard to understand. I took this course as a freshman, he advised I shouldn't in front of the class which was disappointing. Exams are super hard and lectures have way too much detail for an intro course. Labs were great and my TA was wonderful, final project takes most of the semester to complete well. Glad to be done.","Honestly he's not amazing and not horrible. I would have no problem taking him again. He was kind of hard to understand, but overall, you could glean most of what you needed from the test reviews or slides. The lab was great and helped me a ton so maybe take him for that. Definitely, not an easy test maker, but he's good overall."
J. Robinson,1.9,"Marcia isn't understanding or straightforward. I was given clearance to miss class to go to a funeral & was told my assignment was due ""next Thursday""; it was scheduled for THAT Thursday. I didn't get an assignment briefing. It was not graded due to it being in the ""wrong format"". The content was difficult to follow especially in the lectures.",I hate to say this - but the worst professor/class I have ever taken at SU. The class is ridiculous for no reason because Prof. Robinson makes it that way. It is her way or the highway in terms of beliefs or opposing opinions and her assignments are often very subjective and make no sense. Avoid this class AT ALL COSTS.,"Each missed class is ten points off, she does not give a grade for the class until the end of the semester, and you can use the bathroom onlyif you have a medical condition. There were alot of books for this class too, and is not leniant to other people's ideas. For it being a 100 level course, extremely hard. As a person of faith, it tested me too"
L. Minkoff-Zern,3.0,"Mr. Gaddy is a pretty good professor. He takes a while to grade your work but overall he grades fairly and gives great feedback for essays, etc. Hes a nice and understanding professor as well.","I took Mr. Gaddy in what was obviously his first semester teaching. He was not particularly bad or good. The basic structure of the course was to do a reading each night, then come back to class the next day and discuss it. Occasionally there would be a pop quiz but all other grades come from the three essays that you have to write in class.",
E. Coffel,4.5,Lectures were easy to follow and not bad. The quizzes are more like exams and the homework is easy. He isn't a tough grader and is very understanding.,"Great professor! Super easy to follow in lectures. It's not the most interesting class but it fulfills the requirement and its easy to get an A if you go to the lecture and take notes. Pretty easy grader, and the exams make up most of the work",Not engaging at all but very knowlegeable
M. Mazrooie,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
C. Liu,2.8,"Professor was fine. Personally found class really difficult but that wasn't his fault. 3 exams all online which saved me i would have failed. He's interesting just thought the content was super boring. If you have to take this class, i would choose this professor over another","Professor Liu is a great professor. He really tries to make sure the student truly understands the material and how it applies to real life. He is very willing to help, you just need to go to him first during office hours. He gives lots of extra credit and gives partial credit on problem sets on tests.",Very kind professor. Genuinely wants the best for his students but the course content is just a little difficult.
M. Lorenzo,4.2,"One of the worst classes I've ever taken. Exams r now in person and impossible to do well on, he won't help unless you have below a 45. Homework is hard, time-consuming, and irrelevant the exams. His notes are impossible to follow bcs all he uses are random letters and symbols. The content is not very difficult but the way he teaches makes it hard",Attendance is technically mandatory through an online poll. You can really learn everything through the hw because you do the hw on this online textbook where they give you practice problems and learn the material. You get 3 tries per question so you should be fine. There's also weekly discussion posts. Exams are now in person but pretty short.,Super nice guy. Knows his stuff. Grades are 3 tests and HW. HW is 25% of your grade and easy which is very helpful if you don't do well on a test. Attendance isn't taken and lectures can be boring but they are helpful and not going would make the tests much more difficult. Overall not a tough class. Take it with this professor.
S. Brancato,4.3,"She listens to your questions. she does everything she can to ensure that you understand what is being taught and takes the time to help you if you don't. Her assignments are tough but she will help and answer any questions she deems appropriate. If you pay attention, ask questions, do the work and actually try it'll be an easy A.",Professor Seale taught me a great deal over the course of my class. I believe I will be a better paralegal in the future thanks to her!,
D. Laing,3.6,"Professor was kind and willing to explain any question. TAs held labs going over material a few weeks/days before exams (attend- they actually help). Biggest issues: hard to understand when professor speaks, doesn't go off textbook for lectures, lecture notes on paper, and need to read and teach yourself everything to succeed. CAN use AI on tests.","This class was such a breeze. I went to 3 lectures overall and finished with an A+. Homework was optional and our exams were what he called ""extremely open book"" so we had access to the internet. He also only put in highest 2/3 exam scores. However, although he is very easy going, his lectures are pretty difficult to understand.","The teacher doesn't post any of his lectures on Blackboard and all of his notes are written on lose leaf paper. That being said, all the exams he gives are open notes, like you can use any notes and the web to take the exams."
A. Jonelis,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
D. Solis,5.0,"I don't know if he is still teaching, I took him in 2013 and he was a GREAT professor, he teaches you life lessons that you won't forget, he is amazing and makes you exit that class after every lecture thinking that you are a great person and you can do great things in life, hope he is still teaching. ALL respect to this professor","Am one of those that are very shy when it comes to public speaking,D Mann gave me the courage and confident to stand and speak in public. He makes you understand that no one is perfect; that we are all here to learn. Take him, you will be glad you did!!!",
Y. Lin,1.0,"I did not have a good experience. The atmosphere was consistently negative, and it felt as though she thrived on making students feel inadequate.",,
"A. Jonelis
A. Jonelis",3.0,"This man is TERIBLE!!! I would never recommend this professor to my worst enemy. He is the biggest mansplainer; all he does is read the slides, then test you on stuff he's never given you. He also makes you believe you are failing the course when you truly aren't.","Classes were all lectures outside of exam review and exams. Attendance was taken through irregular in-class worksheets. His class requires you to read and take notes outside of class. If you participate in class and take the time to read the textbook/slides, you will be fine. Exams can be challenging, but he did curve all of them.",He is very negative and so is the environment in his classroom. Content is also very difficult and poorly explained. I am sure he is a lovely man outside of the classroom though.
I. O'Connor,1.9,"PROS: Gives extra credit in exams, uploads annotated slides, availability, help sessions for exams CONS: Doesn't bother to learn names, no partial credit, kinda boring, over-explains unnecessary topics/ideas (wastes class time), stops mid-sentence if he sees a cell phone, slightly discouraging towards his students","Would avoid him at all costs, terrible instructor. Makes the physics department here look like a joke. Makes you pay to do homework which he never goes over. You have been warned! Would give him 0 if possible.","You get a cheat-sheet on tests, however the tests are nothing like the problems you do in class or on the homeworks or the practice exams."
D. Dutkowsky,3.4,"Easiest class I've ever taken. Such a good professor. Provides all slides and online lecture videos. Only graded on 4 exams and 2 short assignments. Exams are very simple if you watch the lectures. Class requires minimal effort, highly recommend.",I took his online class over the summer and it wasn't that hard. 4 homework assignments 50% of your grade and 2 exams 50% of your grade. You're able to use your notes and all course materials for your exam. Watch every single lecture thoroughly (1hr & 40min) and take notes. It might be draining but you can easily get an A like this it's worth it,Prof. Dutkowski clearly loves what he teaches. He tries to make lectures fun and tries to help you understand. 4 tests and 1 from the first 3 tests gets lowest grade dropped. He doesn't take attendance but if you don't go to class you will be confused. Take lots of notes the tests are open notes! Overall the class is awesome and so is Dutkowski.
B. Kingma,2.8,Brief introduction.,Useless knowledge. Inexplicable homework. Only TA helpful,1-Knowledgeable professor 2-Everyweek quiz and homework and those cause you to be prepared for exams 3-Helpful professor 4-Provide opportunities for extra scores with extra assignments 5-Good experience 6-I suggest you to get the course
M. Ali,3.6,"This is a basic intro class, so it is what you make of it. Don't skip and pay attention in lectures because she walks through everything and has in-class assignments. She was nice and wanted students to understand and do well. She doesn't share her content with CLASS, so you can't get tutoring but if you take notes and do the work, you'll be fine.","I enjoyed her class, it was pretty easy if you showed up and paid attention to what she was saying. She has an accent but if you sit closer to the front its easier to understand her. She's kind and her tests aren't very hard. The final exam is online.","Do take micro with her if you can have another professor. The content is fairly simple and comprehensible, but her exams are worded terribly, she does not provide study guides and puts the most random things on the exams that he did not spend more than five minutes on in lecture, while excluding the main concepts."
P. Cappers,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her. She is a great teacher, but confusing. You should go over her power point and do homework problems and you will receive an A."
R. Monarch,4.5,"one of the BEST ECN prof in SU, nice person with huge knowledge base. Dont expect the course will be easy, its a 400-level class. Mainly study in model and graph, do not require a lot of math. Study hard, the n you get A.","Super nice, passionate and knows what he's teaching. Tests are kinda hard so need to study but material isn't impossible. Grade determined by 5 HW's based on effort/completion, 3 easy writing assignments based on a podcast and 3 tests. Grading scale helps a lot (85 = A, 70 = B). It's what you'd expect of an upper level class and I would recommend.",
J. Kubik,2.0,"This professor is awful, he doesn't really care student. His class's mean is about 50. Avoid. Run","Not an easy course. He assigns weekly homework and the homework is hard. However, the grading is easy, and solutions are provided. The exam is the hardest. Although he offered practice exams, the solutions are not given. The questions appear on the actual exam are usually different from what you did in the practice exam.",Homework is hard but grading is easy. 2 exams. Would recommend taking.
T. Pearson,5.0,"Compared to other ECN professors bc a lot of them suck, he's definitely one of the best professors I've had. Despite it being an 8 am, he makes it very engaging. When we do go over complicated information, he does a great job of simplifying it. As long as you listen and engage in lectures, you will do well in this course. Also, he takes attendance.",classwork is not too heavy compared to other 300-400 ECN courses. Just actually attend lecture and do the readings and you should be more than fine. His class is very well structured and he is always willing to help !! enjoyed his class,The class is well structured. A lot of the content is easy to follow and he is very approachable if you ever have any questions. I would say you do have to study a bit to do well but if you are just looking to pass showing up to lecture is enough.

P. Singleton,1.9,"By far the worst professor I've had at Syracuse. If you have the option, take this class with someone else. Lectures were useless, office hours didn't help, and the only way to pass was to read the book and teach yourself everything. The exams were fair but way too hard considering how unprepared we all were.","The worst econ professor I've ever had at Syracuse. You will not learn anything and you will have to teach yourself for exams. There's no point in going to lectures. TA's can't even help and office hours are useless. If you can take another professor for this class, do yourself a favor and do it. If not, get a tutor or find a genius. Good luck!",He is so quite when teaching and he just thinks that we know everything
A. Tobias,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
H. Borges Jales,3.7,"I think Professor Jales is the best professor I've ever had. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW STUDENTS LEARN. He is very clear in his explanations of topics and is great at reinforcing what you have learned before. If you pay close attention during lectures and do the problem sets, you honestly don't need to study for the exams, which are very straightforward.",Hugo is the best!,Very helpful and clear. He is very excited about teaching and extremely helpful outside of class.
J. Shu,4.3,"She was very passionate about her class, and always stayed on topic of the subject. She is an easy professor to listen to her lectures, and I would take this class again. Some of the topics are a bit confusing. Your exams and quizzes make up your grade.","Course can be difficult if you aren't familiar with philosophy terms and arguments, there is no intro to this. Need to be able to understand very abstract ideas and write essays about them. Class is interactive and discussion based.","Uses a no-technology policy which is not enforced. However, students are expected to engage with the material which often leads to interesting discussions. There are frequent pop quizzes to test knowledge of in-class material and weekly readings. She is a very engaging professor and makes mundane topics interesting."
M. Deza,4.0,"While Prof Deza does go over material quickly, it is all straight forward and she posts everything on BB. She goes over examples in class and the homework is good prep for the exams. She's super nice and willing to help. For 300 level econ I think this was a good class.","Professor Deza is a really sweet and caring lady. I can tell that she is very passionate about what she is teaching, but unfortunately it is really tough to grasp concepts in class. She moves really quickly and you're only graded on problem sets and tests (both are the same weight). It is tough to get help outside of class too.",
Y. Lee,1.1,"Moon seems to have knowledge of course content, but 0 teaching ability or execution. She makes up assignments on the spot (tons of busywork) and grades harshly without ANY feedback. She makes you work really hard to understand her instructions and grading rationale, then doesn't uphold what she said. Queen of loopholes and unethical behavior.","I had her for two classes, and this one began my avoidance of her. She can't explain things, and forces you to learn the content on your own. The entire class was a group project, and the only reason why my group bonded was our mutual disdain of her. If you want to learn, avoid her and take classes with any other PR professor.","This was my second class with her, and it was as terrible as I remembered. For an ethics course, she struggled to even explain the basic ethical concepts and it took me so long to grasp. I was one of the few participants in the class, and I felt like I was forced to participate. Avoid her for your own sanity: she drove me insane twice."
Y. Hou,4.6,She's the best and make sure to go to lecture for examples,While attendance isn't mandatory go! She is the best lecturer ever and in recitation the TA's give quizzes on examples from her lecture. If you put little effort into this class you will do well. Extra credit is super easy to get you just have to participate in examples. SONA studies are required for the course. I wish she taught upper levels.,"Houck's lectures were always so much fun. Lots of extra credit opportunities and she is very engaging. The course is rather demanding with a lot of reading and assignments on the side. Saying that, there are lots of opportunities to get your grade up."
J. McPeak,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"

S. Khan,1.0,This professor was truly one of the worst teachers I have ever had. His lectures are just him talking and he always uses variables in all of his examples and even study guides which is really bothersome because there is like 30 plus variables instead of numbers or words which would be much more helpful to understand and practice concepts.,"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!I Lectures are confusing, he's a tough grader, and exams are weighted heavily. Study guides are given just 2 days before exams, and you only have 30 seconds to answer pop quizzes given in lecture. In my three years at Syracuse, I've never experienced a class like this.",

"A. Deyhim
E. Bogucz",3.7,"He is honestly one of my favorite professors. He is hilarious & truly makes the class fun. The grading in the class is very fair, 90+ to get an A & they give so much partial credit on exams. The exam questions are just textbook questions. So practice that & you will do well. He also cares about his students' professional growth, which is very nice.","Honestly i really recommend Dr. Deyhim, he does go a little bit fast during his lectures which causes a lot of people to fall behind but if you do fall behind he is very open to going over the problem again and helping you out. He always jokes around in class but is still very serious and tries to make sure that everyone understands the material.","This professor seems friendly, but in fact he always has unrealistic ideas. The requirements are very strict and even require students to do additional tasks even if the project sponsor does not have such requirements. As long as you don't do things perfectly according to the unrealistic ideas in his mind, be prepared to get low scores."
"F. Zigunov
F. Zigunov",1.1,"Terrible teaching style where he crams material into lectures without doing practice problems, wont give practice exams or relevant questions to study. Random quizzes which you will certainly not do well on unless you review the notes consistently, and read along in the textbook. He grades the tests very hard and throws a curveball question in.","Leactures were ok, followed the textbook so reading before helps. Exams included topics not covered and were impossible. The amount of work required to pass was insane. It felt like he was trying to punish the class out of frustration with his inability to effectively teach the subject. Very condescending and hostile in general.",Simple... Dont take this class

"Y. Wang
Y. Wang",4.7,"Great Prof, answers all your questions and is very accessible through email.","Her class is extremely easy even though you have never learned any coding in your life.

The quizzes, it is hand-written quiz, so you only need to study a bit before it. Easy A for sure.","Across the entire semester, the class is being relatively easy. And the quizzes appear not hard at all. Although there might be some tricks, their difficulty is rather not to mention if you do all the labs and homework on your own. Sometimes she might give out an extra credit question/HW. She is very helpful if you ask her for help. Great prof!"
K. Martinez Soto,3.3,"Great Professor! Tough at first, especially in 100-200 level classes. He will definitely tell you what he is thinking. However, he pushes you to be a good designer and ultimately really cares about his students.","Rod Martinez killed my passion for design almost immediately. The design is subjective, however, he did not grade or teach in this manner. Make something he doesn't like? Be prepared to have him humiliate you in front of your peers. Some weeks I got little to no feedback. He is smug, condescending and unwilling to help.","Rod's the man if you have tough skin, but one of the best teachers in comm design"
E. Wing,3.0,One of the worst courses & professors I've had at TWU. Beyond frustrating that this course is ONLY taught by her & is required for the degree plan. I take her class online & the way she has Canvas structured is very messy and confusing. Beware if you take this course online you HAVE to show your work by scanning in your test problems.,"Please do not take this professor! She is honestly the worst professor I have taken. Her lectures are extremely confusing. She jumps from problems and pulls examples out of her head. She also ""teaches"" extremely fast and does not slow down. The majority of students in our class are failing and she does not care. Save your GPA and DO NOT take her!!",Worst professor here. It is extremely unfortunate that she's the only one teaching this REQUIRED course. You'll need to purchase the book which she CONSISTENTLY says NOT to refer to because you basically need to do the math her way. Huge waste of money.. you're looking to pay 150 just to access the hw. At least hw is due at the end of the course?
R. Aboutaha,3.5,Prof Kabi is super fun and tries his best to make online classes entertaining and interactive. Would definitely take his class again!,"Easy class - he's a funny, quirky guy. You can do the minimum and do fine, or do extra and get a good grade. He's disorganized + relies on class discussion basically the entire time - almost no lecturing. He's flexible and a little out there but the case studies are interesting. A good way to bolster the GPA if you're willing to do a little extra",Professor Kabi was amazing - absolutely recommend his courses to anyone who has the opportunity. I've been using his teachings in my real job for over 3 years now. By far one of my most memorable professors at NYU.
C. Johnson,2.0,MGT 462 (was not listed)- All she does is lectures and the HW are all based on the lecture slides. The exams aren't bad but you do need to study since it was 50 questions all multiple choice. You also have to complete a project. It wasn't a bad class just annoying.,Tammy Johnson teaches about accountability yet refused to take accountability when she lost the attendance sheet and gave everyone -4 attendance points. She is incredibly boring and her homework and tests feel almost impossible to get 100% on.,
Z. Qin,1.9,"Worst professor i ever had, never pick any of her classes unless you are Chinese student because she values only Chinese student and tries her best to let all other students down as much as she can, avoid her forever if you want to succeed.","Unclear Instructions throughout the course for Lab, Project.","Nice, intelligent lady but a terrible professor."
"D. Negussey
D. Negussey",3.5,"Quite possibly the worst teacher/professor of my entire life. Entire lecture is done on MathCAD but he doesn't teach you how to use the program. Grading policy is very unclear/inconsistent. Professor is not capable of booking a room with enough seats for all students to use a computer to see his lecture, even though his lecture is done on computer.","You will be using MathCAD a lot and with the class being online, you have to do the classwork during lecture and submit it right after. The exams are all on Mathcad and based on the classwork and homework. It's a pretty simple class overall with it being online","Very boring, and hard to follow. Gives hw without covering material and then MAY go over that material before it is due (no textbook either). Exams are IMPOSSIBLE, he gives multiple parts and each part is a full length problem they are difficult and time consuming. Refuses to answer questions outside of class. AVOID!"

The hour and twenty lectures are a lot to take in but the semester goes by quickly. Don't sweat if you don't do incredible on the quizzes, show up, do your work, study, and ask for help.","Absolute snoozefest. If you enjoy a monotone voice and a boring subject look no further. He just reads off the slides and has participation questions. I have no idea what the quizzes are based on, as I practiced and learned all the material yet never got above a 75 on a quiz. Can't wait to be done with this class.","Professor Tuttle clearly knows a lot about water, the topic for this course, EAR 205. But, his lectures do get a bit boring. Thankfully, he posts all lecture material online. There are 3 ""quizzes"" over the semester- they are moderately difficult and doable as long as you study. Recitations are super easy and usually let you out early."
C. Davidson,3.3,He is a super sweet guy and tries to give the most information he can. He has to work with Joan Dannenhoffer for this class and that's hard. He really wants the best for his students!,"Great teacher, he cares about students and their success. He provides examples to make sure you understand.","Davidson tries hard to be very clear in lectures and to make sure his students pass the class. Sadly, he fails. CIE 274 is a different animal; group projects are emphasized, conceptual thinking is the major element in the class as opposed to competitive thinking, and there are many minute but important details that Davidson fails to highlight"
S. Todorova,3.4,Unprofessional. Not engaging whatsoever. Why is she a professor?,Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible Terrible.

He explained the content very clearly and made me enjoy the class. Truly an amazing professor and person.,Professor Trimmer has hands down some of the best slides out there. The content is always laid out in an easy to read manner and his lectures that go along with the slides are great. I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Trimmer if you have the opportunity to.
K. Yu,1.7,"Avoid this professor at all costs, if I could I would give him a zero. After the first exam, my friend and I just stopped showing up and learned the class on our own... our grades went up. The strategy is to memorize the steps the practice exams, which are almost word for word copies of the real exams. This professor is truly ""Yuan in a Million"".",I'd rather watch paint dry than listen to a Yuan Yuan lecture. He is EXTREMELY boring. I didin't got to class the last 2 months of the semester because I was better off teaching myself. If YUAN'T a daily migrain you should attend his class in the morning.,Professor Yuan often reads directly from the slides and takes a while to explain concepts clearly. Decent amount of homework. Two fairly easy and straightforward midterm exams and weekly quizzes that were also simple. Go to class and office hours!
E. Lui,3.5,"He knows his stuff but remote learning is tough and graded by homework, quizzes, and labs. Quizzes are 50% of the grade so you need to make sure to do well on the quizzes or you won't pass the class. He will not change the rules for anyone and if you make a mistake, he won't help you. You will need to deal with it and the TA try their best to help",Great Professor! Recommended,"His courses are great, and I love them. He explains the theories clearly, which helps me a lot to understand them. Besides, I can tell he takes a lot of effort to prepare the notes, homework and exams. He is one of the best professors I have had."

A. Staniec,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
J. Romeu,1.3,"Romeu definitely knows his stuff. Unfortunately, he has no idea how to teach. He breezes through the material as if it was a review course, and puts most of the work on you. Regardless, if you put the effort in, you will learn a LOT from his class through group projects and selfwork. The course its is not hard - he just doesn't explain things well.",GREAT PROFESSOR. yes there is a lot of work which he expects you to take responsibility for on your own but you learn a lot if you put the effort in. I learned a lot from him because of all the work he expects us to do on our own!,"Am I the only one who liked this guy. Yes his class is hard, he is not very helpful, and he is even worse to follow, but I sure did learn a lot"
U. Roy,2.2,"Definitely the hardest prof for COM 117. We went at roughly 3x the speed of any other 117 class. Roy was not understanding or accommodating at all. I had to miss classes due to a head injury and he did not give me an extension on one project and docked major points from another for it being late. As other reviews said, it's his way or the highway.","He was extremely strict with deadlines, and was a very hard grader. He moved way too fast, and he did not give us any of our grades back until the last week of the semester so we had no idea how we were doing in the class. Try to avoid if you can, because he is by far the hardest COM 117 professor.","By far the hardest prof for COM 117. We went at about 3 times the speed of any other 117 class (though we were basically done by thanksgiving break). Not understanding, not accommodating, its his way or the highway. Only positive is that I got good experience with Premiere, but was so strained that it wasn't enjoyable at all. Switch if you can."
Y. Moon,1.1,"Moon seems to have knowledge of course content, but 0 teaching ability or execution. She makes up assignments on the spot (tons of busywork) and grades harshly without ANY feedback. She makes you work really hard to understand her instructions and grading rationale, then doesn't uphold what she said. Queen of loopholes and unethical behavior.","I had her for two classes, and this one began my avoidance of her. She can't explain things, and forces you to learn the content on your own. The entire class was a group project, and the only reason why my group bonded was our mutual disdain of her. If you want to learn, avoid her and take classes with any other PR professor.","This was my second class with her, and it was as terrible as I remembered. For an ethics course, she struggled to even explain the basic ethical concepts and it took me so long to grasp. I was one of the few participants in the class, and I felt like I was forced to participate. Avoid her for your own sanity: she drove me insane twice."
S. Sassone,1.7,So many people didnt like this professor but i loved the class. She made it entertaining and easy to participate in. She also cancelled class alot or moved it to zoom which was nice.,"Dr. Sassone is a very tough grader and didn't give a single grade back until the last week of classes, giving no time to improve your grade. The class day to day wasn't too bad, but she had a tendency to randomly give homework due the following day. Wouldn't recommend, try and see if theirs other professors available.",This professor only talks about her boyfriend and her car. Has an attitude for no reason. Very opinionated. Grades very harshly for no reason and she does NOT give A's. She also used her migraines as a complaint to not grade but will give you endless homework assignments and will wait until the end of the semester to grade them.
C. Feikes,2.7,Be ready to work and not know when it's due. It's very disorganized. There are three quizzes and three major units (projects and essays). Very sweet. Be prepared to work.,Great professor! Lots of experience and very concerned about how you can use this class to help you get a job after college. Always asked about our internships and other learning outside of class to make the writing more relevant,Lots of work great professor really sweet and wants the best
S. Turkkan,5.0,I loved this class so much. Professor Turkkan constructed amazing lectures and assignments that I truly enjoyed doing. She genuinely seems to care about her students and I developed a lot of confidence in this class!,I really just appreciate Prof. Turkkan so much. She thinks about writing and language in ways I haven't really encountered before.,SO SO nice. Really cares about her students. I felt like my writing improved so much. I felt like there was a decent amount of outside reading but it was very managable. She is willing to work with all her students and builds a relationship with everyone. I saw her months later at a restaurant and she remembered who I was and started conversation.
"E. Dressing
E. Dressing",4.0,"She repeats the same thing over and over again and her grading is quite hard, but not impossible. Her class is lecture heavy and its quite boring and group project is just a burden. She offers some extra credits. Overall, not really bad, but the work load is unbelievable......",Emily was the best writing instructor I had at SU. She usually responds back to your email in three hours and always willing to meet with students. Her grading is not super tough. You will have to write some paper since it is a writing class but she will provide clear directions. There are some chances for extra credit as well.,"She is really good writing teacher compared to many others, but she had a very high standard"
I. Kleinbart,4.4,She is a great professor and really cares about her students and their successes. I highly recommend this course and having her as a professor.,She's very caring and provides valuable feedback.,"Great professor she's so nice and bubbly, if you need help with anything she's always there to help you out, had a great semester with her!"
A.

P. Hawkins,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her.

N. Samigolla,4.8,"It has been nearly 7 years since taking Proof Delillo's ASTRONOMY class and I am still fascinated on just how much I learned and retained. Every Celestial event, meteor shower, or just a clear night I look up and smile remembering how fun and engaging his class was. Thank you for being an awesome and caring professor Mr Delillo!","I took oceanography and I am bad at science. He made it easy, understandable, he follows a routine that makes it doable and able to follow. He keeps us engaged, he's funny and probably my favorite teacher of the semester. He's great, ps I took this class over zoom.","Good science class. Quizzes are weekly and not easy, but he tells you how to study for them. No outside homework besides studying for quizzes and tests, but still take a few hours before quiz and test day to review everything. Very knowledgeable."
T. Gerken,3.8,You'll have a great time in the class if you make an effort to connect with him. He is often trying to connect with students and the ones who didn't reciprocate it seemed to always be bored but the ones that did seemed to really enjoy the class. He also has great stories and doesn't mind getting off topic to share them. He also genuinely cares!,"Very sweet and caring. Likes to make jokes and makes the lectures much more enjoyable. Love Prof! I would say there is a lot of work to do, but it's manageable.","He takes his class way to seriously for what it is. We have spent the entire semester only talking about metaphors and he hasn't given any advice in writing. Lots of in class assignments that he will not allow you to make up, even if you have an excuse absents note. Never gave helpful feedback or clear instructions and was impossible to meet with."

S. Wright,2.2,"Professor is keen on using busy work to fill time in class. Lots of homework and reading that don't seem to amount to much at the end of the semester. Grading is strict on papers and projects and points seem to be taken off for just about any level of mistake, no matter how minor it may be.","Even though I learned in fine detail, she is a tough person for her personality and her grading system. Beware of that but if you like to be challenged take her.","On the first day of the class, she said that not many of her students get above a C in her class. She assigns an insane amount of homework and projects. And grades all of them very strictly. I advise you to try and take this class over the summer. If you end up receiving her as a professor, I advise you to switch."
R. Panthee,3.2,"This is probably the easiest class I am currently taking, that being said, you better not make eye contact with this man or you will be his main focus point for the rest of the semester. He cares a lot but assigns a ton of out of class readings and generates major assignments entirely with ChatGPT, not even bothering to proofread what he assigns.",He talks and talks and talks and talks,"Very nice teacher, easy class, show up to class"
H. Zorluel Ozer,4.5,"Really nice prof. She cares a lot about her students and encourages revising assignment grades. Also, you only need to show up to 70% of the class but there is a participation grade based on the stuff in class so def try to go. lectures are kinda boring but they go by quick since she makes u do partner work. 5 assignments overall and really easy",very kind and caring professor. read her feedback because she allows revisions. overall she's a good wrt105 professor,
K. Hanzalik,2.4,"Assignments are unclear, would be reasonable but the expectations/requirements are explained up until the day that a large assignment is due, making for quick turn arounds and surprise criteria for important work. Passive aggressive responses when asked for clarity or help. Tense class environment when confronting confusion on assignments.","The class itself isn't difficult at all, we had three papers and then one final presentation all of which can be revised for a better grades by a certain date; it's just the fact that she's very passive aggressive and makes class miserable.","Coming from a student who Aced her class, SWITCH OUT!! Professor Hanzalik is the worst professor I have had in my two years at Syracuse. She falsely accused me of using AI on our very first paper because it wasn't ""my voice"". She had no proof or justifications of why she believed that, and I can only assume she stereotyped me."
C. Geyer,3.8,"Definitely one of the best professors. Although her feedback on essays can be improved, she grades easily and is lenient when it comes to assignments. She is also easy to talk to and will try to help students out as best as she can.","WRT105 Overall I liked this class and found it super easy. We only did 3 papers in the unite and very minimal writing otherwise. The papers were very easy and she grades pretty easy as well. She is a late grader and doesn't give the best feedback, but her assignments are pretty straightforward","Dr. Geyer's grading was a lot of the time affected by her personal opinion of you. She would not really explain things, and would just give page numbers in the textbook. While her personality is better and she is engaging, her feedback and grading criteria are not clear and she will just take points off wherever she wants. She was funny though."
J. Pan,3.2,"This is probably the easiest class I am currently taking, that being said, you better not make eye contact with this man or you will be his main focus point for the rest of the semester.

N. Moore,4.4,Dr. Moore is a great professor! She gives a clear syllabus and calendar at the start of every unit (there are only 3). Attendance is required but if you miss a day she gives clear instructions on what you need to do. She is a very kind and caring woman. There is a lot of homework but as long as you organize your time well you will be fine.,"This class had a fair amount of work, and the unit calendars provided helped a lot. I wouldn't say it's any more difficult than the average high school English class.","Dr.Moore is awesome. Her class is easy to understand. She always gave me full credit for late work. The coursework is not vigorous, she is encouraging, and she helped me improve my writing. My class topic was not one I was particularly passionate about but she still managed to make it interesting. I would take one of her classes again if I could."
E. O'Toole,3.0,One of the worst courses & professors I've had at TWU. Beyond frustrating that this course is ONLY taught by her & is required for the degree plan. I take her class online & the way she has Canvas structured is very messy and confusing. Beware if you take this course online you HAVE to show your work by scanning in your test problems.,"Please do not take this professor! She is honestly the worst professor I have taken. Her lectures are extremely confusing. She jumps from problems and pulls examples out of her head. She also ""teaches"" extremely fast and does not slow down. The majority of students in our class are failing and she does not care. Save your GPA and DO NOT take her!!",Worst professor here. It is extremely unfortunate that she's the only one teaching this REQUIRED course. You'll need to purchase the book which she CONSISTENTLY says NOT to refer to because you basically need to do the math her way. Huge waste of money.. you're looking to pay 150 just to access the hw. At least hw is due at the end of the course?
R. Bartels,4.6,An amazing professor! He's super understanding but he often yaps so be prepared to do a lot of other classes homework during this time. Lots of reading responses and easy grades to get if you just lock in. An A is easy to obtain in this class.,"Professor Bartels really wants you to get an A! Class is mostly graded from 3 major projects, but you get a lot of class time to work on these, and they aren't that hard to begin with. There is a reading and a short response before almost every class, but they are super simple. Lots of extra credit is available as well.","I was taking the toughest classes this semester, Rusty is the breath of fresh air I needed In my schedule. Incredibly nice and very considerate. The writing assignments are lengthy but you have so much time to develop them with his entire support and he grades fair. In this class I actually learned something, take this class if you are considering."
A. Zouaoui,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing.

J. Wood,3.0,"Tedious class with out of class assignments and essays but the class itself isn't necessarily hard if you put in the work. Lectures aren't really necessary, I'd go but you don't need to pay full attention. Worth taking with her, nice teacher","Lauren is a nice person. I had issues with TA Aren Burnside, he was a terribly unfair grader and super unclear with directions. I zoomed with Lauren to discuss his grading and she understood my side and thought he was being unfair. Aren ruined my experience and everyone else that i asked said the same. It was way too much work for a 100 level class","The only reason you should take this class is for IDEA or writing-intensive credit. It has such a heavy workload with 400-word papers on 3 different 100+ word readings due every week, 2 essays and a photo essay and portfolio. You have to spend so much time outside of class to succeed and the lectures are such a waste of time but mandatory."

R. Meriwether",5.0,Great profesor genuinely cares about her students. Lecture is always interesting and engaging,"She is the best, you won't regret taking this class",
M. Haas,4.7,"Dr. Haas is super nice and a very easy grader. But, she lectures every class and strongly expresses her political views, which can be frustrating at times especially because this class is not related to politics at all.",WRT 205 is an easy course if you are engaged in class and complete all assignments. The lectures are interesting with the topics discussed. The professor is very kind and lenient with students.,"Lots of assignments, but they are relatively easy and explained well. She cares about her students and there are a lot of opportunities for extra credit. Participation/attendance matters!!! Def one of the best professors you can get for WRT205."
K. Oakes,4.0,"I love Dr. Oakes! She has a quirky sense of humor that I find adorable. I had her for Pharmaceuticals and Drug Delivery, and Biotechnology in Med and Public Health. Her drug class was structured and flowed well, but her biotech class was super jumbled and some of the assignments were pointless. Do the work and you'll get an A! Some extra credit.",It wasn't all that awful. There are a lot of readings that you would have to do on your own. Basically was all the information that you've learned in the last 4 years compiled into one course.,

W. Stavenhagen Jr.,4.1,"Although his instructions can be unclear a lot of the time, he is always ready to help you understand them if you have any questions. Overall very chill, laid back, funny guy.","Overall good teacher but can get a bit picky when it comes to grading. He really wants his students to be themselves in their writing but also do what he wants. 3 textbooks must be purchased which can be annoying. If you participate, do the discussions on time, and follow all his strange guidelines you'll pass!","Professor Stavenhagen was my favourite of the 3 writing professors I had here. Engaging professor, but sometimes it feels like he has favourites to call on in class. There is a lot of work to do, with 4 projects to complete over the course of the semester."
C. Brooke,3.0,"Prof Brooke was so accommodating during Fall semester. I took his classes asynchronous and he'd send an email with the one assignment due for the week, you could honestly work at your own pace and he was nice about submitting things late. You have two portfolios that you submit with some of your work, but not hard at all.","The worst professor I have ever had. Unfortunately, his health is poor but because of that he canceled class very often and only sent a substitute once. Our grade was based on three papers (the last one he never even gave me any comments on and it was 8 pages!). He made the class feel like a waste of time AND money.",

Collins deeply cares about his material, and he wants you to care about it as well. He is a tough grader, but he always provides good feedback to improve for the next paper.","I'm a 4.0 high school student. Lost all interest in school. After 5 semesters of going through the motions, Collins gave me a reason to be excited for school. Nothing he teaches is easy to understand, nor is it compelling material. However, his knowledge and willingness to be personable is a strength. He will leave you WANTING to read more.",He best professor
J. Russell,4.8,"Nice guy. The class had no attendance, but the lectures were very fascinating and visually stimulating when I went to class. One online quiz a week, and 3 online exams. Easy, but also interesting. Worth your time.","He is a great professor who really cares about his students. You don't have to show up to class, and tests are open-note and online. Apply yourself somewhat, and you will do well.",Ed was so nice and easy - half the classes are just watching ads the other is lecture - the study guide he gives for exams are the exact exam so its easy to get a good grade but also easy to never go to class because he doesn't take attendance - lots of extra credit opportunities
R. Rowe,3.5,Prof Kabi is super fun and tries his best to make online classes entertaining and interactive. Would definitely take his class again!,"Easy class - he's a funny, quirky guy. You can do the minimum and do fine, or do extra and get a good grade. He's disorganized + relies on class discussion basically the entire time - almost no lecturing. He's flexible and a little out there but the case studies are interesting. A good way to bolster the GPA if you're willing to do a little extra",Professor Kabi was amazing - absolutely recommend his courses to anyone who has the opportunity. I've been using his teachings in my real job for over 3 years now. By far one of my most memorable professors at NYU.
Z. Yang,5.0,"Follow his code, go to the lecture and u will be fine.",,
R. Moucha,3.0,posts lectures on blackboard but using them as a study material is practically useless. Most slides are random diagrams with no explanations.

Tests are little bit hard and lectures aren't easy to follow. However, don't be hesitate to ask him questions cause he's willing to answer every single one. Put efforts and go to office hours.","The class consisted of JUST online hw and exams, meaning you could Quizlet pretty much everything & still get a good grade (thats what I did) unless this class is part of your major ofc. Homeworks are extremely long so start them early."
M. Woodley,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
L. Streib,2.3,"I stopped going half way through the semester. I just started reading the textbook and putting more effort into the homework. No final, four exams, Unit homework consists of about 25-40 questions PER chapter within the unit. She does give extra credit, for our section you had to go to 10 tutoring sessions throughout the semester.","Nice person, not a great professor. Really quiet (could barely hear her in lectures) and packs a ton of information into not a ton of time and goes really fast.",She was nice enough but I consistently had issues understanding what was happening in class because she moved way too fast and didn't really have any information on the slides. There was also a lot of homework assignments per unit. She did give opportunity for extra credit.

She knows her students and will learn your name really fast so get ready to be pointed out to read or answer a question. When i took her she didn't miss a class or cancel. she would send email and writes back to you if you write to her.,Do good on your essays. Make sure to keep up with the readings as well since she always gives quizzes daily.
D. Curewitz,4.6,Course is pretty easy prof is great but McGraw Hill quizzes are psychological torture.,"For someone who struggles with anything STEM-related, having Professor Curewitz was a dream! Super funny and always ready to talk to a whole class or one student in his office, he helped me and made learning earth science much more interesting and helpful. Rambly, unique, and slightly too optimistic about what he wants to do, you wont forget him!","Professor Curewitz is a great person and truly cares about his students and field, but my lecture was very far behind the scheduled course material. This made recitation, lab, and especially homework very hard. Recitation didn't help me learn at all and the TA did not want to be there. Go to lecture, take quality notes, go to office hours, study."
Z. Wang,2.4,One of the most boring classes I have ever taken during my time at university. Class does not relate to the course description and would never have taken that class if I knew what I was getting into. Avoid her.,"Professor Wang was very knowledgeable and interested in the subject matter, and though she tried her best to make the subject matter interesting, I feel she often fell short. She wasn't a hard grader, but her assignment instructions were vague, and she didn't provide helpful feedback or clarifications on what she expected in your final product.",HOM165 was not the most interesting class but an easy humanities course as long as you do the weekly textbook reviews and study the lecture slides for exams. There are 3 exams that are very detail orientated based on very insignificant material from the lecture. The study guides are word for word for the short response section but nothing else.
M. Brannon,5.0,"He's really good at explaining each lesson with clear, concrete examples. There weren't any lecture slides—everything was pretty much from the zyBook. Attendance isn't a big deal to him, so he won't nag you about showing up. I'd definitely recommend taking him.",,
J. Mejia,3.5,The class is very interesting and Professor Mejia teaches it well. She has experience in this field and explains things very clearly. But she is unresponsive by email and sometimes even doesn't listen to specific students during class discussions. She also assigns several papers/projects to do at one time.,"Professor Mejia is a real gem. Not only is she very well educated on the subject of intersectionality, but she also has lots of experience in the field. She is extremely kind, and she was always happy whenever students participated. The papers for the class were actually very interesting to work on, and she was very fair with grading. She's great!",
H. Garcia Delgado,1.9,"I was so excited to take his class, but it's been a major let down. He lectures exactly from the textbook using a and does not bring any additional material or insight to class. I asked him to help me with an assignment and he told me that he doesn't do that. Hey shows up late& takes extra long breaks- he comes across to me as very lazy.","Very disorganized class; he spends a majority of class time rambling about current events/ his opinion then springs information never covered on the midterm. We hardly got through the chapters of the book. As someone who took a policy class before, I learned absolutely nothing from this man. He would take ""20-min"" (actually 30-40 min) during class","Professor Garcia is probably the worst professor I've ever had. You are WRONG unless you say exactly what he is looking for. Completely unfair grading. If you have the chance to take another professor, DO IT."
"C. Junium
Staff",3.2,"good person, terrible teacher. likes to go tangentially at a topic",I went to class once the entire semester and have a B. everything is on quizlet. tests are a bit heavy but homework's and labs make up for it. if you actually went to class you would probably get an A. very easy class tho def recommend,His lectures get a little boring and there seemed to be a disconnect between his lectures and the questions asked on the test. That being said the test grades were heavily curved.
R. Polk,3.5,Prof Kabi is super fun and tries his best to make online classes entertaining and interactive. Would definitely take his class again!,"Easy class - he's a funny, quirky guy. You can do the minimum and do fine, or do extra and get a good grade. He's disorganized + relies on class discussion basically the entire time - almost no lecturing. He's flexible and a little out there but the case studies are interesting. A good way to bolster the GPA if you're willing to do a little extra",Professor Kabi was amazing - absolutely recommend his courses to anyone who has the opportunity. I've been using his teachings in my real job for over 3 years now. By far one of my most memorable professors at NYU.
L. Ivany,4.1,"Prof. Ivany is the best professor at this university. Her paleobiology class is tough, but she is always willing to help students. Very nice lady.","Do not take this class if you are looking to fill a science requirement. It is defintiely not a 100 level class, and I should have gotten a much higher grade in it considering the amount of work that I put into the class. AVOID THIS CLASS","Linda genuinely cares for her students and is extremely helpful if you have questions. Exams can be tricky, but a lot of your questions can be cleared up if you engage in discussion during class and lab time. This class does require a good amount of time an effort for an A, so be ready to work. (only used the textbook to look up confusing topics)"
T. Logie,3.1,Worst professor I have ever taken and this is not dramatic. Participation counts as 30% of your overall grade. Goes around the class one by one as you answer questions from the exercises in the book every class but somehow some people will receive 12/12 and some will get failing participation grades. If you want a fair teacher do not take him.,"He's not a bad professor overall, but he made the class a bit confusing. He wouldn't answer questions clearly and he went over the material a bit too quick sometimes. There is a midterm and a final and you usually work in groups during class.","Great Professor. Overall easy class. He makes it very easy to understand. Weekly online quizzes, if you read the chapter you will have an easy A. No homework, just a midterm and final both open book."
P. Bonilla,5.0,"Valentina was a great TA for EAR-105. Always was willing to help if you attended the in-person time for the Recitation, but since all of the recitation coursework was online, and all that was needed was for it to be completed by the end of the week, many people just didn't show up. No issue though since I don't believe attendance was really taken.",,
C. Scholz,2.0,"Extremely knowledgable about the subject. Has high expectations of his students to really know the material, read the textbook, and work hard in the labs. A lot of students seemed to complain about the work, but it seemed reasonable to me. Expect labs to be completely different than what's reviewed in class. Definitely read the textbook!",The living proof that the academic system is broken: he doesn't teach and doesn't care about it. Prepare to be asked about things that were never taught. It is really demotivating to have him as a teacher if you are interested in Earth sciences.,"Scholz has been one of the hardest and worst professors I've had. He isn't super engaging and has the propensity to just talk to you for hours (literally). He doesn't draw on the board and relies solely on his PowerP. His test questions are SUPREMELY vague, he WILL dock points if you don't put exactly what he wants, and he does expect perfection."
J. Thomas,2.5,this dude hates his life and makes it his students problem,Hate this guy so much with passion.,Absolutely awful. His lectures are unorganized and honestly just disrespectful for his students. He uses a spiral notebook and writes about 5-10 words a page before he flips to the next. Thats how you learn. He doesnt give you any practice problems instead he just makes them up as he goes. When it comes time for exams there is no study guide.
M. Koch,3.8,"only assignments in the class is weekly homework - which is pretty easy. lectures can get boring but prof. koch is very interesting and passionate about her field. easy way to get credit. no electronics in the class, notes have to be taken by hand.","Geography of Oil is a guaranteed A. Take this class if you need a grade booster. It is pretty boring and the majority of your grade is homework (once a week) and a 30min group presentation. No notes, tests, or quizzes though.","While she does touch upon the subject of urban geography, most of her lectures talk more about (either) colonialism or social justice rather than the actual subject she (claims to be) teaches about. If you ask me, youll be more educated on the subject of urban geography if you mess around with Google Maps than sitting through most of her lectures."
A. Mohammed,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
T. Wen,2.5,"Lectures were engaging. He does some short pop papers in class, but they aren't difficult if you pay attention. The midterm and final were open note and very easy. His weekly homework was textbook quizzes graded for participation. I would 100% recommend him as a professor. He was also very caring about deadlines.","Takes FOREVER to return grades. Lectures were kinda boring; filled with cold calling and partner discussions. Four tests/projects were 80% of our grade; attendance is mandatory but only 5% of grade. Easy class though. All the big projects took no more than a few hours each. Just show up, do the reading & take notes - you'll get an A if you try.",Basically a participation grade for many assignments. Weekly textbook quizzes online that are participation grades. Tests were open note and online. Sometimes cold calls
G. Hoke,2.0,Honestly just not a good professor. Doesn't understand that this class is taken by students who are only taking it to satisfy a requirement. The test questions are not conceptual as much as they require students memorize facts which are gone over in his scattered and tangential lectures. He definitely cares about the material but can't teach!,"Hoke is a very nice guy and pretty cool to talk to. However tests are mostly very specific questions that are hard to prep for because his lectures are just sort of streams of info on a topic. If you take decent notes, do the labs, and find a quizlet for the blackboard quizzes you'll be fine","Lectures consist of a chaotic flow of concepts and a series of equations for which he provides little context. Most of the time he doesn't even understand what he is writing. You are graded by how good your memory is and how fast you can write, and are provided with no feedback. LOTS of homeworks about things that were never taught."
M. Chipman,4.8,TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Such an easy A. All tests were online and all the notes were posted. There was only one assignment a week and you hand it into the TA's mailbox if you don't want to go to the recitation. Highly recommend.,"She's a doll, literally the sweetest woman ever. I went to lectures 75% of the time, but you don't have to. Her lectures are very engaging, and she is so passionate about what she teaches. Please go; it's sad only about 25 people show up. It was very easy A. The TA was also super helpful and nice! I would recommend going to the recitation.","Did not go to class once. Recitation once a week but you don't have to go, just turn in the assignment, but if you do go the TA's are super helpful. Exams are fully online. Would totally recommend this class if you're taking a super heavy course load and need an easy elective."
S. Samson,2.8,"Lectures meander and are incredibly boring. Very nice guy but did not enjoy this class at all. Exams cover random material mentioned offhand, and study guides are incomplete. There are no other grades, just tests. If you are looking for an easy or fun natural science, keep looking","Most over hated professor. If you study with the study guide he gives you will basically get an A. He gives bonuses if you pay attention. He says you should read and buy the textbook, but really you can find it free online, or just take good notes in class and study. SIT IN THE FRONT! He will learn your name and joke with you and look out for you.","Never uploaded anything online to Blackboard. All of the exams were purely memorization based on lecture material or stuff that was straight up said in lecture and never brought up again on paper. Professor also had an attitude, was always quiet and had horrific humour. All in all a lot of information to digest, and very difficult to stay engaged."
C. Newton,3.5,Very passionate professor and interesting subject. She cares more about students learning than earning a grade. Can't wait to take another class with her.,Class is super boring. Nothing she talks about is interesting or useful. Not a lot of work. Professor is very nice and cares about students.,
K. Cadwell,4.5,Dr. Cadwell is challenging in the best way I learned a lot in the course! Taking notes helps and she is to questions which great. I would recommend the course and also she is really cute does anyone know if she is dating?,She overworks her students if you take her class it will be the most stressful class you ever took,"Great teacher, her notes are very thorough. Just go to class and get the notes down. Even if u feel like ur confused in class you can go through your notes and it will actually clarify things. To pass her class you do need to put in some level of effort but it is worth it. Also she is cute (rare in Chem E) so makes it easier to concentrate :D"
T. Walker,3.5,This was a field seminar pass or fail. participation was required in some classes but not in others. She took attendance but then asked us to check it at the end of semester and make sure it was correct. lectures were mildly interesting. Most of class was spent with students discussing their issues or concerns in field placement.,,
I. Hosein,4.7,"He's a super cool guy but the class was very poorly run. Since AI came out, we're encouraged to use it for EVERYTHING and while that's a useful skill, we never learned the point (and how they work) of all these data analysis tests that we just gave to the AI. Hosein is very nice and accommodating. No exams, just 2 massive projects, could use AI.",Professor Hosein is a really smart and fair teacher. His lectures are easy to pay attention to and follow. The homework is easy and doesn't take any time at all. The assessments are one on one interviews where he asks you questions about the content. If you pay attention you will get a good grade.,"I've had Professor Hosein for multiple classes and my experiences with them have all been positive. His courses are very manageable because his lecturing style makes it easy to understand topics, he is very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches and relates everything to real-world engineering applications. Exams&HW are easy-great prof!"
"A. Joseph
A. Joseph",4.7,Clear grading criteria and caring teacher. Lots of feedback.,I would not take this course again. His lectures were boring and the way he taught did not help me personally.,"One of my fav professors ever. harsh grader when it comes to writing components of tests, but still possible to do well on tests if you prepare. I took notes on readings and lectures and studied for a few hours and got an 102% on the midterm (after a 10% curve), however, if you are not prepared, you will pay (the average was like 70%)."
A. Sangani,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
J. Bond,1.0,Hardest class that will teach you nothing for your future as an engineer. Pointless,,
S. Nangia,4.3,"She listens to your questions. she does everything she can to ensure that you understand what is being taught and takes the time to help you if you don't. Her assignments are tough but she will help and answer any questions she deems appropriate. If you pay attention, ask questions, do the work and actually try it'll be an easy A.",Professor Seale taught me a great deal over the course of my class. I believe I will be a better paralegal in the future thanks to her!,
J. Marum,4.3,"genuinely such a kind and nice professor, very relaxed and very willing to help with any questions/assignments even exams! its impossible to get a low grade in his class, as long as you do your assignments and he even gives extensions if you need. go to his office hours just to chat or ask questions and hes always there to help :]",Very hard to understand for first couple weeks. He often goes on tangents that have nothing to do with course material. He often comes unprepared and disorganized to lecture. He is a very easy grader and is an easy A. He will basically give you answers to the test if you ask him questions. Lectures are just reading off slides for 1he 20min.,Professor Joao Marum was awesome. His lectures are fairly easy and the professor also is very funny and always tries to make its lectures interesting and fun!
G. Silva de Oliveira,3.0,"I absolutely love Thiago. He is extremely flexible and will meet you outside of office hours if you cannot go. As long as you meet with him when you need help and show effort, you will get an A.",Very difficult. There are much more easier professors for this course.,
K. Micinski,4.0,"More functional programming (yay). Difficult and abstract topics throughout the course. Autograder assignments make up a majority of the grade, and make sure to start these early. Tests are fair but require studying. Listen to his posted videos and look through his posted code, it solves large portions of the assignments.",,
S. Older,4.8,in susan older we trust genuinely the only reason i know anything regarding computer science at this university. carrying this program on her BACK,"Dr. Older is really great - her lectures are very helpful and she is really good at teaching. The material isn't the easiest and there is a lot of homework, but she allows you to resubmit hw for more credit. Her tests are hard but only because you need to know what you are doing. Overall, she is a very great professor and teaches very well!!","Professor Older is great. Her lectures are structured well and she has a clear plan every day. The way she organizes CIS 375 makes it very easy to do well, as it avoids the typical class structure where doing badly on one exam ruins your grade. She's very helpful outside of class and clearly wants all her students to do well."
C. Mohan,1.8,"Friendly and not bad at lectures, but everything is described so broadly that it is extremely difficult to figure out what to do. Assignments usually have a single phrase describing what to do. Pop quizzes demand attendance, and group projects result in 40+ page submissions.",Worst professor I've ever had. Don't take this course.,"You do 2 projects for the class, one individual and a group project, if that wasn't terrible enough, you also have to sit through very boring lectures that can be summed in 15 minutes instead of a whole class time. There's also quizzes that he gives a vague timeslot for and announces the actual timeslot last minute. He is funny but too much work."
F. Rahman,4.8,"Absolutely the best professor of the EECS program. She will go extra miles to help you succeed. I wish she taught all CS courses. Go to her office hours. Make sure to complete weekly reading, lab and HW and you will be fine. There are plenty of opportunities for students to recover their grade. You just need to put in the effort.","Lectures are good, clear and concise, however she does go at an extremely fast pace and all the material builds onto each other so if you miss one lecture you're doomed for a bad grade. Weekly lab assignments and weekly home works. First exam is the hardest, next two exams are easier. TA's are helpful in Lab for debugging.",THE best professor in the program. Seriously. Don't be intimidated by her and go to her office hours if you're struggling. Show up to lab
J. Pollack,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"

M. Baruch,3.6,"4 tasked OpenGL C++ projects & 1 open-ended final project. Progression: Static 2D, UIs, Animated 3D, fully controllable 3D (game!). Projects are SUPER intensive if you truly want to excel. Build your shape functions, workflows, & tools early on; they make future projects easier! Baruch is inspirational. If you go for the bread, guaranteed A.","4 smaller projects with clear guidelines and 1 bigger project that you choose is the entire class. Easy if you can grasp the computer graphics material, expect to work on the smaller projects for at least a few days.","So like I am very honest. This course is not hard, but as it relates to the professor she is just relay strict on academic integrity but she knows her stuff. She could use some better GAs though. Practice, pay attention to labs and you will be juts fine. This course is python heavy and that's all. As long as you have the right attitude it is easy."
V. Gandikota,5.0,"I learned a lot from his lectures. He assigned a lot of homework and problem sets, which were very helpful. The Zoom recordings he provided were useful throughout the entire course. His explanations were very clear. He is a tough grader, but I would love to take his classes again.","Although I received an average grade, I learned a lot from his lectures. His explanations were very clear, and he gave many assignments and practice problems, which helped a lot. However, he is a tough grader. I would love to take his course again.","His class is hard, however, his lectures are very detailed and he explains each concept thoroughly. If you show up to his lectures, you will 100% pass. He is very nice and funny as well. There is no homework grade, however, you will be graded on quizzes that are weekly and 4 exams. He prints out notes as well, which makes it easier to follow along."
J. Zhang,3.5,"For PSC 300 AI Ethics. You're mainly graded on your midterm and final, along with two small in-class presentations that are easy to do. She allows AI to be used in class.

She means well but you are not graded on much. 2 tests, 1 paper and recitation participation.",She is so passionate and kind! She gives lots of extra help and the exams are so fair and easy. The only homework is reading
R. Zafarani,3.2,Reza is good introduction to programming but he doesn't do great on expanding on his process of how to think about programming. There isn't really homework and the labs are really the only moderately challenging part of the class and it's still relatively easy,"Reza is a good guy but struggles with teaching. I'm in CIS-151, an intro programming class, and he lectures us as if we are experienced programmers. I'm almost done, but feel like I've learned little. Also, assigning homework only in the last few weeks feels random. Take him only if you're already familiar with the material.","Does not explain concepts well. He clearly does not care. If you take this class, just read the textbook. You will learn way more by teaching yourself than in lectures."
S. Kumarawadu,1.0,"Very nice professor and fairly easy course, but the course was taught extremely poorly.",Took two of his courses in Spring 2023. He had very little knowledge of the subjects and was very difficult with grading. Despite doing great the entire semester he scored everybody badly in the finals saying everything was plagiarised for both courses.,"I consider myself as an above average student and I have got A-/A grades in other similar and difficult courses but this prof. had no undestanding about the subject and failed so many students without reasoning, many students lost their scholarships and TA chances because of his negligence, so many students wrote so many mails to him at the end."

S. Soundarajan,4.0,Lectures are sometimes hard to follow and to get good at material you have to do lots of practice problems. 3 exams total with weekly quizzes in recitation. TA was more helpful than Prof. Soundarajan. Very strict about no cheating on exams. We had to put all electronics into a ziploc back and lock the bag and put the bag on our desk in front of us,"Professor Soundarajan is knowledgeable , but the teaching approach is disorganized. Lectures lack structure, slides are unclear, and exams are overly long, leaving students rushed. I had to rely on YouTube to understand the material. Better-organized lectures, clearer slides, and manageable exams would greatly improve the course experience.",She grades extremely harshly and is inconsistent with offering feedback on why points were lost. She is also concerned with cheating to the point it gets in the way of learning. She IS knowledgeable about the subject but often looks down upon students who ask questions. Avoid this professor if possible.

V. Phoha,2.8,"This professor zones out while he is teaching. Sometimes in such situations we come back home and try reading the notes.

Run away, u wont learn a word.","I took for Biometrics, the course was a lot of work but the final project accounts for the majority of the grade. 2 Exams both were long and difficult but he is fair and understanding. I would take another course he taught if it met with my interests.","Took CIS400/600 Cryptography with Phoba.

M. Mihovilovic Skanata,2.3,In this class right now and genuinely have no idea what she's talking about like every single class period. I'm sure she doesn't know what she's talking about either. It's not worth it. Take physics at another college because a common theme amongst physics professors I've had in Syracuse is that they never know what they are doing ever.,"Worst professor I've had. For reference, I am a 4.0, pre-medical student. She appears nervous, has trouble controlling the class, speaks too softly, and assigns homework on topics never discussed in enough depth. I resorted to wasting my time by teaching myself through the textbook. People have given feedback, but I have yet to see improvement.","She actually listens to the students concerns & will always makes time to meet even after office hours. Grades super fairly, the exams are identical to the practice problems in class, quizzes, and tests. She gives extra credit. She has weekly quizzes, two tests, & one final. Also, there are homeworks due every week. I would recommend this class."

Highly recommend as a fun elective."
W. Freeman,2.8,"Very good professor. I love when he reads my Discord DMs to the whole class. He's charming, easygoing, and always helpful—willing to meet one-on-one outside of class.

Constantly rude and always annoyed with her students, asked for help multiple times on assignments before and she said “idk figure it out”. Horrible with technology not to mention.","Horrible Professor, DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!! 4 exams that she doesn't even cover and if she does she expects you to already know the material when clearly you don't and its the reason why your taking her class. When you go to her office hours she seems annoyed, not very helpful.","She was a very helpful teacher in my opinion. She always made time for students to come bug her at her office for help. When she didn't know an answer off the top of her head she would look it up with the student. She wants students to succeed, but also expects that you will read the book to learn concepts. I highly recommend her."

I believe I will be a better paralegal in the future thanks to her!,
J. Yousefian,4.6,"JJ is a great teacher. There is homework every lecture, but he is very helpful in his office hours and responds to emails/texts if you ever get stuck. His lectures are clear and to the point, and he provides old tests from previous semesters as study material for tests.","J.J. is an outstanding instructor. He has prepared handouts for every lecture that are easy to follow and great study tools. Homework is due every lecture, and it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. There are 4 exams, but use the practice exams he provides to study, and there is no reason to get below a B in this class.","Super good at explaining concepts, incredible at what he does, is always able to answer a quick question and grades fairly"
J. Hansen,4.3,Cutting edge course with exciting exercises that cover a ton of ground and can get anyone on their feet and playing around with social media tools. There are very few classes like this and I have to say it is one of the best.,"Prof. Hansen planned an excellent online course, however, the limitations of the current online classroom caused a few problems for me. While the individual projects rock and are flexible, trying to meet online with people around the country made group work hard. In addition, you need to self motivate to finish assignments on time. Overall awesome.","Eric Hansen is very dedicated to the class he teaches. If you pay attention and work hard the class is very easy. There are times when I felt I was in over my head, but all the assignments can be completed if you put forth the effort."
D. Van Allen,2.0,"Obviously loves his subject, willing to help if you ask for it.",Van Vliet has trouble expressing what he is trying to teach to the students. Attempt at all cost to pick another teacher.,Should never teach again.
N. Pashine,4.8,"It has been nearly 7 years since taking Proof Delillo's ASTRONOMY class and I am still fascinated on just how much I learned and retained. Every Celestial event, meteor shower, or just a clear night I look up and smile remembering how fun and engaging his class was. Thank you for being an awesome and caring professor Mr Delillo!","I took oceanography and I am bad at science. He made it easy, understandable, he follows a routine that makes it doable and able to follow. He keeps us engaged, he's funny and probably my favorite teacher of the semester. He's great, ps I took this class over zoom.","Good science class. Quizzes are weekly and not easy, but he tells you how to study for them. No outside homework besides studying for quizzes and tests, but still take a few hours before quiz and test day to review everything. Very knowledgeable."
T. Skwarnicki,2.8,"Lab review, so I can't comment on his teaching ability personally. Assignments straightforward and reasonably lined up with both the time available, as well as the topics covered simultaneously in lecture. Most people I talked to agreed they had a good TA, so his judgement in picking the people to run the labs is good. Do the prelab, easy points!",Got annoyed when students asked questions or were confused.,I and other students felt he pushed the job of teaching the class onto the TAs and lectures were really really bad. I get as I got almost nothing out of his lectures and recitation is where you could get anything out of. Tests are much more difficult than given homework and he makes the final exam really hard.
A. Zaratsyan,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.

Once she accused me of a certain thing, I asked her questions because I want to know the full story on why she accused me. It is normal to ask questions when you are curious but she said she did not want to be questioned by me anymore and stopped answering my emails. Saw other students say the same thing. Avoid her.","Dr. J is a nice person and was pretty lenient with my tardiness. However, she is not very technologically skilled which affects the exams, homework, and lectures to the point where there was a lot of misunderstandings that affected my grades heavily. Her accent is also hard to understand at times but I wouldn't count that against her."
S. Ballmer,2.0,"Dr. Ballmer is an awesome guy, very cool and chill. Problem is, his teaching skills are not the best. Exams are SHORT so if you get 3 wrong you're already in the B's and the final exam is split into TWO 15 Question examinations... Meaning if you get 3 wrong on either you are already floating at a B- here. Posts all slides online with no answers.","This class is difficult, despite it being a 101 level. Ballmer will cover concepts quickly and fail to go over problems in class. Questions discussed in class will be put on powerpoints without an answer or explanation on how to do them. Following the textbook is difficult because he skips around and picks and chooses concepts to present. AVOID IT!","Honestly? Terrible professor. I have never missed a single class, took notes the entire time, always listened and worked on the course outside of lecture and I am still doing poorly. He is an awful teacher who does not know how to explain things at a 101 level at all. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO."
L. Roy,2.2,"Definitely the hardest prof for COM 117. We went at roughly 3x the speed of any other 117 class. Roy was not understanding or accommodating at all. I had to miss classes due to a head injury and he did not give me an extension on one project and docked major points from another for it being late. As other reviews said, it's his way or the highway.","He was extremely strict with deadlines, and was a very hard grader. He moved way too fast, and he did not give us any of our grades back until the last week of the semester so we had no idea how we were doing in the class. Try to avoid if you can, because he is by far the hardest COM 117 professor.","By far the hardest prof for COM 117. We went at about 3 times the speed of any other 117 class (though we were basically done by thanksgiving break). Not understanding, not accommodating, its his way or the highway. Only positive is that I got good experience with Premiere, but was so strained that it wasn't enjoyable at all. Switch if you can."
D. Whittington,2.0,"A really boring professor overall. Class lecture material and the questions for homework are completely different, and almost always requires research online to get the right answer. He's okay, just not good.",,
J. Paulsen,4.0,You are graded based on 5 labs and then a final presentation. It is all done using python so there is a learning curve to the assignments. A lot of self-interpretation of the labs is allowed and he gives you a lot of room to experiment on your own.,"His grading scale is very lenient, and uses clicker questions to give you extra credit, up to half a letter grade, which is amazing. His lectures are very helpful and the demos in class are cool. He's very accessible for office hours and is willing to help. The tests are extremely fair, and he outlines what he expects you to know. Would recommend.",
J. Hubisz,3.1,"I have never encountered a professor so rude to students; I do not feel treated as a knower, but treated as a cog in a machine.",The exams are difficult and very different from the practice exams. The homework is long. He tries to explain but it just gets more confusing.,"He's a good professor. He made materials easy to understand, however, his lectures were a little bit boring. He had good demonstrations. The grading scale was extremely curved. Not hard to get an A in this class."
G. Mansell,2.3,Large lecture. Very boring. She seems like a very sweet person though. You get a cheat sheet. If you write down as much as you can from homeworks and lectures you'll do well.,"Georgia was an okay professor. She was definitely nervous in the first half of the semester but she got better. The homework isn't bad but is due at 11 pm rather than 11:59 which is annoying. The tests are okay, we got cheat sheets. The curve also made it so that you could not do the best on the tests and still do ok in the class.","I can't believe she's a professor, teaching is clearly not her thing. Her lectures are a mess, just constant rambling that doesn't help at all. Homework doesn't match the practice exams, which don't match the real exams. Really wanted to do well in this course but struggled so much because of how poorly everything was taught and organized."
M. Soderberg,3.1,"Lectures were exciting and taken straight from the textbook (which was posted on BB as a PDF), but he made them more fun. Got material across in an easy-to-understand manner. Posted solutions to HW and exams afterwards and was easily available to meet with students. You can tell how passionate he is about physics which made his class even better.","Doesnt provide enough information and concepts during the lecture, lecture slides are super messy","Overall I think Prof Soderberg is one of the few professors that know how to teach in the department. It's lucky that I took 212 in spring because he only teaches one semester a year. In terms of the course, it's easy if you pay attention to lectures and go to recitation. The tests are friendly if you study hard. Clicker questions are extra credits"
R. Silva Coutinho,4.0,"he and eric coughlin switched off every time we had a quizzam, i prefer eric because he is easier to understand but rafael was also good!! he studied physics at CERN so hes very knowledgeable about physics; you will learn a lot",,
S. Blusk,2.9,"Professor Blusk is a nice guy who makes himself available outside of class. The lectures can be boring but are essential to doing well. His midterms are not too bad but the final is extremely difficult. Luckily, he curves generously so if you get Bs or high Cs on the exams and terrible on the final (like everyone else), you should get atleast an A-","He gave out the final exam which was extremely hard. Even though your mid-term exams grades were much higher than class average, you'll still get a bad grade if you did not do final well (there was a very small, harsh, and ridiculous curve). His exam average was 50-60s, and he expected you to get 93 to receive an A. EXCUSE ME?",Great.
E. Coughlin,4.5,"good professor, he knew what he was talking about and really taught us well. the only thing ""bad"" about him is that he paces back and forth at the front of the classroom and its very distracting and made me lose focus but other than that a good professor!",Eric is a great guy and a great professor. He works hard to deliver comprehensive slides and put together virtual 3D visualizations and in-class demonstrations to convey the abstract concepts of Physics 2. He's always working to make the student experience better. Get a good TA to cement the process of working through Physics 2 problems.,"Dr. Coughlin is a very compassionate & understanding professor. (Largely due to the material), his lectures can run a little dry at times, but he is constantly looking for ways to better deliver material and help students to succeed. Recitation is totally dependent on your TA, but Dr. Coughlin made multiple changes mid-semester on student feedback."
M. Rudolph,2.1,"He knows his stuff, but he's awful at explaining things. He somehow makes easy concepts hard, and hard concepts stay hard. Don't expect anything beyond his criticisms of whatever book he wants you to read, which somehow focuses on the wrong thing. He's the type of professor that makes you hate math and physics because he's so bad at teaching.",He isn't a great professor but makes the exams easy because he doesn't explain things well. I learned everything from the TAs in recitations.,"His lectures are very monotone and he does not spend a lot of time explaining difficult topics and concepts that should take longer. He seems to want to get through the slides more than take time to make sure students understand the material. He wasn't a bad communicator outside of lecture, but he was very hard to get a hold of"
J. Laiho,4.3,PHY 101 had to take for my major. Im not good at physics but overall i liked the professor. you take two exams and can retake for a better grade both times which was AMAZING. but the final exam didnt have that option. The labs were confusing but helped my grade go up and the HW are weekly and graded on completion and some accuracy.,"Laiho is hands down one of the best professors since I transferred. His lectures are amazing and engaging. Giving credit for completeness and effort is a majority of how things are graded, but the tests are more heavily based. 4 exams In total but only accepts the 2 highest (1 from each unit) which shows his character in caring!","Very patient with students in a class that is not necessarily enjoyable for a non-major. Testing policies really save your grade, and Laiho loves physics and cares that you learn it."
L. Movileanu,3.0,"Mr. Gaddy is a pretty good professor. He takes a while to grade your work but overall he grades fairly and gives great feedback for essays, etc. Hes a nice and understanding professor as well.","I took Mr. Gaddy in what was obviously his first semester teaching. He was not particularly bad or good. The basic structure of the course was to do a reading each night, then come back to class the next day and discuss it. Occasionally there would be a pop quiz but all other grades come from the three essays that you have to write in class.",
P. Souder,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her. She is a great teacher, but confusing. You should go over her power point and do homework problems and you will receive an A."
M. Artuso,1.7,I had her for my CAS101 - First Year Forum (Women In Science) and she was a gem!,"One of the worst professors I have ever had anywhere. Does not speak english very well and is incapable of explaining subject material. Tests do not reflect material ""taught"" in lecture.",let's face it. who in their right minds likes physics? most are not fond of professor artuso. i didn't think physics 1 was too bad. Professor artuso had a cool accent and always had some fun experiments to demonstrate. grading was fair with a strong curve.
M. Manning,3.2,"Like other students said, I would only recommend taking this class if you are a physics major. The course is interesting and teaches you to problem solve rather than just apply concepts. However, I do think that the professor struggles to give elementary level explanations and that the classes is fast paced, but the professor is nice.","She is very helpful during office hours and makes herself available outside of class. You will have to put in work for the class since it is an honors/major level course. For 215 the tests aren't curved. Would only really recommend taking the 215 is you are a physics major, or you really like physics otherwise it's just easier to take 211.",Awesome professor!!!! If you can get her you're gold. Just make sure you go to office hours as often as possible!! You'll definitely need it if you plan on getting good grades. Also physics clinic for homework help. The third exam will kill you but she curves so you'll eventually be ok!
G. Watson,3.8,I had him for PHY312 not PHY216 nut it wouldn't let me choose anything else. Great teacher and really fun. Inspired me to switch majors so I could. study with him more. Really relaxed and just wants us to learn something.,"This professor is really a nice guy, his class is well-organized and he provides online zoom link during coronavirus period. Besides, the homework and exams are online so that it is more convenient instead of handing in the homework to the office on weekends. Also, the lowest grades of lab would be dropped.","He is a nice guy, but a terrible professor. He fails to explain the slides adequately and what we do in labs doesnt line up with what we learn in class. Like I said, hes nice and very lenient because of COVID but hes a terrible teacher"

I felt like I was really able to gain a relationship with her and decided to take another class with her next semester.,"Soc101 is a really easy class not really on her, all my friends that took this got an A. She's kinda boring and the assignments can be lengthy but if you pay attention every once in a while you'll be fine.",If you asked for help she would say there are directions online and if you needed guidance with writing assignments and projects she is not helpful at all.

Recitations had weekly quizzes but were fine.",Best math teacher I've ever had. Goes into extreme detail for everything. HW for every lecture but do it early and you get crazy extra credit. Two easy midterms; just know how to work the study guides. Weekly recitation was useless (mandatory attendance) and TA's were mid. Recitation quizzes were ok. Stay on top of the work and you'll get an A.,"Professor Shaw is amazing. I was scared to take a math class because I have always been bad at math, but I did very well.

If you want a fair teacher do not take him.,"He's not a bad professor overall, but he made the class a bit confusing. He wouldn't answer questions clearly and he went over the material a bit too quick sometimes. There is a midterm and a final and you usually work in groups during class.","Great Professor.

You can do the minimum and do fine, or do extra and get a good grade. He's disorganized + relies on class discussion basically the entire time - almost no lecturing. He's flexible and a little out there but the case studies are interesting. A good way to bolster the GPA if you're willing to do a little extra",Professor Kabi was amazing - absolutely recommend his courses to anyone who has the opportunity. I've been using his teachings in my real job for over 3 years now. By far one of my most memorable professors at NYU.
H. Tabrizi,4.5,Tabrizi is an awesome professor. There is a lot of busy work throughout the semester but overall interesting topics. Tabrizi cares about their students and is willing to help when needed. Highly recommend taking a class with them!,"Professor Tabrizi is awesome. They really care about students mental health and wellbeing! Race, Ethnicity, and Comm was a great class. It had lots of lecture and group projects but I learned a ton from it.",

C. Morris III,4.0,"Although the course content was very boring and mandatory for all first year and transfer students. Derrick did try to make it enjoyable. With a class with FYS, it is hard to make this course interesting. He is a law school student and is very professional and well spoken. Lots of reading off slides and forcing answers out of people.",,
L. Gratch,3.0,"Mr. Gaddy is a pretty good professor. He takes a while to grade your work but overall he grades fairly and gives great feedback for essays, etc. Hes a nice and understanding professor as well.","I took Mr. Gaddy in what was obviously his first semester teaching. He was not particularly bad or good. The basic structure of the course was to do a reading each night, then come back to class the next day and discuss it. Occasionally there would be a pop quiz but all other grades come from the three essays that you have to write in class.",
C. Perrello,4.8,"Interesting, useful, and easy course with a knowledgeable, understanding, and friendly professor. What more could you want for a business communications course?","Great professor, you would not regret taking a course with him. I took both IST343 and IST344 with him in the same semester. He is a great speaker and clearly enjoys teaching. He does a great job of connecting educational material to how that knowledge would be used in a professional setting.",Best professor ever. Cares about his students and teaches real life skills to use in not only school but also your career. Great guy
D. Grimes,3.9,"This is my first time writing comment and I really like Dr. Grimes' class. As long as you follow the instructions and submit your assignments on time, you'll be fine for this class. Attendence is mandtary but the class is super interesting and fun. And you will be offered an ec to boost your grade.","Grimes is my absolute favorite teacher at this school, her courses are super easy and make you feel very comfortable and relaxed! homework assignments can sometimes be lengthy but are super simple. class discussions are very engaging and help you see multiple different perspectives. I have taken all her courses and loved each one! Easy As",I couldn't recommend Grimes more she's a wonderful woman and has a great teaching style that makes her class and her content easy. Easy class. Impactful. No papers. No Tests. Relaxing. Take any of her classes.
K. Phillips,4.0,"Great teacher, but moves very quickly. He is a very honest grader and doesn't care about much. Cancels class all the time and ends class early almost every day.",,
K. Pynn,4.7,"I took AEW and it really helped me with Calc 1, my TA Mac was really nice and would help us understand a lot",World's Best Boss,good and very kind
E. Bogucz,3.0,One of the worst courses & professors I've had at TWU. Beyond frustrating that this course is ONLY taught by her & is required for the degree plan. I take her class online & the way she has Canvas structured is very messy and confusing. Beware if you take this course online you HAVE to show your work by scanning in your test problems.,"Please do not take this professor! She is honestly the worst professor I have taken. Her lectures are extremely confusing. She jumps from problems and pulls examples out of her head. She also ""teaches"" extremely fast and does not slow down. The majority of students in our class are failing and she does not care. Save your GPA and DO NOT take her!!",Worst professor here. It is extremely unfortunate that she's the only one teaching this REQUIRED course. You'll need to purchase the book which she CONSISTENTLY says NOT to refer to because you basically need to do the math her way. Huge waste of money.. you're looking to pay 150 just to access the hw. At least hw is due at the end of the course?
R. Tanchak,2.5,Profesor Tanchak does a great job breaking down and explaining the problems. Just need to make sure to do the hoimework and attend each class and recitaton.,"Bob assigns homework and then does the problems in class the following class period to reinforce the material. Because of this, there's not a ton of teaching and the material can become confusing. Random quizzes and homework collection is not uncommon. He's a very personable guy though and you can tell that he cares about all of his students.",the best way to imagine having robert as your professor is by imagining a substitute gym teacher in highschool trying to teach you math.
A. Shen,2.8,Fantastic professor.,"well, he's a great teacher teaching a boring subject. the first half was ok once you get the key to solve such kind of problems, but i couldn't help sleeping in the last 1/3 of the lectures. in addition he repeats important points while giving new material, you don't know when to ""have a rest""",his lectures make Ben Stein seem outgoing. Do not take this class unless it's a requirement or you absolutely love logic.
T. Zhang,3.5,"For PSC 300 AI Ethics. You're mainly graded on your midterm and final, along with two small in-class presentations that are easy to do. She allows AI to be used in class. Attendance is done via. Google Form, which are posted at the beginning on class, so you don't need to physically go if you don't feel like it.","Okay class. She means well but you are not graded on much. 2 tests, 1 paper and recitation participation.",She is so passionate and kind! She gives lots of extra help and the exams are so fair and easy. The only homework is reading

"T. Zhang
T. Zhang",2.0,"Lecture slides are impossible to follow, he skips multiple steps in his work. He copy and pastes from the textbook to his lectures. Does not go through problems step by step in lecture, just reads off the slides. Talks the entire class to sleep without event noticing it. He's a really nice and smart guy but couldn't teach a fish to swim if he tried",Absolutely horrid professor. Could not teach me how to breathe if he tried. His powerpoint slides had no information and he would actively edit then while teaching which made them impossible to follow.,"This professor is hands down the worst professor I have ever had in my entire life. He will repeatedly make alterations to his PowerPoint while teaching which makes the lectures impossible to follow. Additionally, you will look at the homework for 30 minutes and have no idea how to even start the problem. I would not recommend to anyone."
S. Mack,2.0,"She's super boring and rambles for the whole 80 minutes. You will feel like you learned absolutely nothing. If you know how to write, she'll like you.","She isn't as bad as some people say. She'll go on tangents, or a single point is dragged out more than it should. She is willing to listen to people's thoughts and expand on it. The papers can be a bit hard if you are not good at analysis. But the best way to pass this class is to take notes, do the readings, and just do your best on the papers.",She is annoying and laughs and coughs all the time and doesnt stop her sentences when shes coughing. I dont like her and she is not helpful.
"J. Pierce
J. Pierce",2.9,"Majority of the grade is 7, 600 word papers. Lectures are kind of underwhelming, and nothing in the class ends up being that deep. He does recognize that everyone in the class is required to be there and probably isn't passionate about engineering ethics, and he is very fair with grading, attendance, laptop policy, participation, etc.","Graded on 6 papers, 5 discussion boards, attendance, and a final group project. The papers and discussion boards are short and easy. He's a nice guy, a little eccentric, but he's good at lecturing and introducing new/nuanced topics. Overall, an easy, painless class.",Doesn't have clear lectures and is super boring. Doesn't provide notes and takes forever to grade.

"C. Coutermarsh
C. Coutermarsh",3.1,"she is caring. if you want to get A, you can have it",she's an easy grader and helps you if you ask. She knows her students and will learn your name really fast so get ready to be pointed out to read or answer a question. When i took her she didn't miss a class or cancel. she would send email and writes back to you if you write to her.,Do good on your essays. Make sure to keep up with the readings as well since she always gives quizzes daily.
P. Momtaz,3.8,"Dr. Dhillon was a phenomenal chemistry teacher. Lectures are informative and you don't even have to touch the book. Tests were fair and straightforward (directly from the PowerPoint notes)! Chemistry was not easy, but this woman made it a breeze and really wanted her students to succeed. Her HW solutions were great. Take her you won't regret it!","Dr. Dhillon is very motivational inspires students to accomplish their academic goals, her test are easy if you read the book and do homework, her lectures are a bit confusing but this was due to the nature of covering four chapters per week in a winter course so reading the book was essential to understanding the concepts, highly recommended.","Honestly, she is a really cool person. She graduated from Berkeley and received her PHD from Harvard. She knows what she is talking about, but she is still new to teaching. I highly suggest you to take her. She is a great teacher, but confusing. You should go over her power point and do homework problems and you will receive an A."
J. Golden,2.5,Very difficult professor suggest to not take this course Lecture is too heavy,Dr. Golden is a very knowledgeable professor and means well. He can come off a bit strong and be intimidating but it is because he wants his students to grow. His assignments can be unclear at times but he is an easy grader as long as you put in the effort.,
